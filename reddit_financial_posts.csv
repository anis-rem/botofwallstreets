These currency pairs in forex offer unique chances but also come with more risks than popular major or minor pairs. In this blog, we’ll look at what exotic currency pairs are and how you can trade them safely.

# What are Currency Pairs?

Currency pairs in Forex are two different types of money from two countries that are traded together. In simple words, it means you exchange one currency for another. This is how trading happens in the Forex market.

**Every forex currency pairs has two parts:**

* The **base currency** (the first one)
* The **quote currency** (the second one)

The base currency is the one you want to buy or sell. The quote currency tells you how much you need to pay to get one unit of the base currency.

**Example:**  
Let’s say you are trading **EUR/USD**.

* **EUR** (Euro) is the base currency.
* **USD** (US Dollar) is the quoted currency.

If the rate is 1.20, it means **1 Euro = 1.20 US Dollars**. So, to buy 1 Euro, you need 1.20 Dollars. This is how **currency pairs in Forex** help people trade money from different countries easily.

# Types of Currency Pairs in Forex

In the Forex trading in the UAE market, **currency pairs in Forex** are divided into three main types: major, minor, and exotic. Let’s understand the first two types.

# Major Currency Pairs in Forex

**Major currency pairs** are the most popular and most traded currency pairs in the world. These pairs always include the **US Dollar (USD)**. Because many people trade these pairs every day, they are easy to buy and sell. This is called **high liquidity**. Also, the cost of trading them is low, because the **spread** (difference between buying and selling price) is small.

**Here are the 7 major forex currency pairs:**

* **EUR/USD** – Euro / US Dollar
* **USD/JPY** – US Dollar / Japanese Yen
* **GBP/USD** – British Pound / US Dollar
* **AUD/USD** – Australian Dollar / US Dollar
* **USD/CHF** – US Dollar / Swiss Franc
* **USD/CAD** – US Dollar / Canadian Dollar
* **NZD/USD** – New Zealand Dollar / US Dollar

These pairs are linked with strong economies like the USA, Europe, Japan, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

# Minor Currency Pairs in Forex

**Minor currency pairs**, also called **cross currency pairs**, do **not** include the US Dollar. These pairs are made by trading two other major currencies. They are also popular, but not as much as the major pairs. That’s why they have a bit higher trading cost than the major ones.

**Here are some examples of minor currency pairs:**

* **EUR/GBP** – Euro / British Pound
* **EUR/AUD** – Euro / Australian Dollar
* **GBP/JPY** – British Pound / Japanese Yen
* **AUD/JPY** – Australian Dollar / Japanese Yen
* **EUR/CAD** – Euro / Canadian Dollar
* **NZD/JPY** – New Zealand Dollar / Japanese Yen
* **GBP/AUD** – British Pound / Australian Dollar

Minor pairs still offer good trading options for people who want to explore beyond the US Dollar.

# What is an exotic forex pair?

**Exotic currency pairs** in Forex trading are made of one **major currency** (like the US Dollar or Euro) and one currency from a **smaller or developing country**. These currencies are not traded as much as major or minor pairs.

Because fewer people trade these pairs, they have **lower liquidity** (not easy to buy or sell quickly) and **higher spreads** (more cost to trade). This means exotic pairs are **riskier** and may change in price more suddenly.

But for some traders, exotic pairs also give chances to make big profits if they understand the risks.

**Here are some examples of exotic forex currency pairs:**

* **USD/TRY** – US Dollar / Turkish Lira
* **EUR/TRY** – Euro / Turkish Lira
* **USD/SGD** – US Dollar / Singapore Dollar
* **EUR/THB** – Euro / Thai Baht
* **USD/ZAR** – US Dollar / South African Rand
* **USD/HKD** – US Dollar / Hong Kong Dollar
* **USD/PLN** – US Dollar / Polish Zloty

These pairs are useful for traders who want to explore new markets and have experience handling higher risk.

Otherwise you'll run on confirmation bias & overfit strategies.

# Create rules for consistent entries and exits;

Underpinned with a plan to behave just like the backtest. If you can't behave 1:1 drop it.

# Backtest your system (do not tweak rules)

 do not curve fit yourself system; if it doesn't work trash it. 

# Process your backtesting data

In a spreadsheet to get important values such as peak to trough drawdown (R) and avg monthly return.

#Execute as soon as your system data is processed and ready; 

Short term trading edges will fade with time naturally.

# Don't share your edge.

Alpha decay, prop firm expulsions and many other negatives. You have your specific profitable trading strategy, keep quiet **[2]**


# Bonus: How to keep your profits and survive

# Isolate your trading capital

instead of depositing $10,000 ex. Trade high risk on $2,500. Do not remain overexposed your edge can stop working at any time. Your working capital should always be small relative to total risk. Abuse compounding.

# Withdraw. 

You must withdraw at equity highs when your strategy is performing well especially on high risk models. **[3]**

# Don't get complacent 

Always test new systems and ideas constantly even if at equity highs; your strategy breakdown is always an unpredictable suprise. Have a replacement in mind regardless of performance.

**When your strategy deviates from it's backtesting behaviour ex. Large profits instead of celebrating reduce exposure/withdraw. When your drawdown exceeds maximum peak to trough drawdown on testing drop the strategy and withdraw everything.*

# Buy assets. Skip the cash hoarding. 

Regardless of what happens trading-wise do not sell what you accumulate.

If I own quality stocks (say, PSU blue chips), I can just keep selling weekly or monthly call options and collect 2–3% in premiums regularly.

Even if the stock falls — that’s fine, I wanted to hold it long term anyway.
If it rises and gets called away — cool, I still made a profit and can just buy it again on a dip.

So where exactly is the catch here? Why don’t more investors just follow this steady, disciplined approach instead of trying to predict the market or chase multibaggers?

Is there something I’m missing beyond the usual ""stock can fall"" or ""you cap your gains"" argument?

Unfortunately, I learnt the hard way that backtesting needs to be performed precisely in trading.

***I decided to compile this for anyone who may find it useful.***

*Note: Numbers in square brackets are references to books, articles, or theses which I* have *read over the years and are some of many that apply. These sources apply directly to live trading despite some of their titles. They are found at the bottom. The following text is written concisely on purpose to avoid wasting your time, I want to provide good information while respecting your time.*

Reading between the lines is recommended.

# 1    Background

Obviously, by testing a strategy with historical data, you can get an idea as to how the strategy used to perform in the market \[1\].

Now, it is vital to understand why backtesting is essential and what counts as proper backtesting.

You have probably realised that not every form of backtesting is useful. It is also not an exact way to measure whether the strategy will be successful in the future, but it does allow you to ensure that your strategy is not detrimental to your portfolio to some extent. Of course, we cannot be perfectly sure that a strategy will work, but it does provide an idea and acts as guidance.

# 2    Backtesting

I have noted that backtesting is taught in a very imprecise way by existing trading educators. First we must realise that backtesting is extremely unreliable if used incorrectly, and this occurs because human intuition and emotions play a large role here (my next post will cover real market psychology). This leads me to directly challenge discretionary trading. So called trading educators ask you to backtest your system and write down how you ”feel” with each trade and what your findings are. Which, if done literally, is an extremely subjective way of looking at the market. It is unreliable in terms of hindsight bias, data snooping, and so on. You neglect that every time you backtest, you will end up with different results and conclusions. If you have no experience, then this advice does seem sound.

I wish to save you time by telling you that you cannot collect useful data from a non-useful imprecise strategy. A simple way (which I alluded to a moment ago) to check if your backtesting is precise, is to identify whether your backtest would output the exact same numbers if you did it again a week later.

Being precise and being profitable go hand in hand.

# 3    Data Quality

It is also highly important, and often overlooked, that the data is of high quality. Accurate, high resolution data is pivotal for making trustworthy conclusions. Using flawed or incomplete data will lead to a ”garbage in, garbage out” approach \[2\]. Even a well-defined strategy can produce misleading results if the underlying chart data in the backtest is not accurate. This means that sourcing data from a reliable platform is vital to the integrity of your backtest.

Flawed data can include inaccurate historical data, not using the same chart for backtests as live trading, curve fitted parameters, and so on and so forth.

Keep in mind that this is much more important for strategies that use a limit order for entry fills.

# 4    Overfitting and Curve Fitting

Another point of concern is overfitting or curve fitting, which happens when a strategy is tailored too closely to past data, making it less adaptable to new market conditions \[3\]. This practice essentially cheats the backtest, yielding overly optimistic performance metrics that are unlikely to be replicated in real trading. The more parameters a strategy has, the easier it is to overfit it to the data. The key is to aim for the simplest possible model that explains the underlying order flow mechanics. For instance, it is best to avoid a strategy that has a truck load of rules, where, the strategy only achieves profitability when these rules are tweaked in a way to make it profitable based on past data, like turning the knob one millimetre to achieve the perfect temperature in the shower. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the market, it is extremely common that such a strategy will cease to profit in live conditions.

In short, this means that the strategy should only have just enough rules to cover the scope of price. For instance, there needs to be a way to filter what direction price is going. You need a method to determine where your entries must be, and then, with respect to your entry, a point where profit should be taken and a point for the stop loss should be known.

When you begin to introduce more rules, excessive amounts, then it becomes very easy to tweak a strategy to fit past data giving the illusion that it is profitable.

# 5    Role of Transaction Costs (Vital)

Lastly, it is vital to incorporate transaction costs into your backtesting process \[4\]. Often, strategies look profitable in a backtest but become far less profitable when applied to a real-world scenario due to unaccounted-for costs like slippage, fees, human errors, and so forth. Ignoring such costs can give a false sense of security and coupled with the fact that your strategy was back tested beautifully, will lead to confusion, as the live trading does not seem to match the profits predicted by the backtest, even if the same win rate and average risk to reward ratio is achieved.

Note that this is also, and I cannot make it more clear, EXTREMELY important when it comes to trading using a proprietary firm as your drawdown and profit determine whether you lose or pass onto a subsequent stage.

I can provide a simple example. Kindly consider the following:

We have a system of 25% winrate with a risk to reward ratio of 1:4 (reward is 4 times the risk), where this data was pulled from an imaginary backtest we had performed.

In the backtest, all was well, we predicted a decent amount of profit per month. However, in live conditions it turns out that we actually made significantly less money than anticipated... why?

The reason for this is because we neglected that there were costs in the form of spreads and slippage.

Say we had 0.5 points of slippage on average

and we have 2 points of spreads

with a minimum† stoploss of 10 points

this leads to the cost of 26% (this is calculated using the equations I had derived personally for optimising my strategies). What this means is that my effective risk to reward ratio after accounting for costs is actually 1:2.96 (reward is 2.96 times the risk).

Surprisingly, this whole time, we were actually trading with a risk to reward ratio of 1:2.96, and this was not obvious before performing this analysis. This explains why we made significantly less profit than anticipated. We thought we were making $4 for every $1 risk whereas we were actually making $2.96 for every $1 risk in live conditions.

 †*Why minimum? Well, because a smaller stoploss means that our costs increase. A stoploss of 10 points with a spread of 2 points means that the relative size of the spread is large as compared to the stoploss.* *However, if a stoploss is 30 points, then 2 points of spread has less of an impact, but it should not be neglected.*

You are probably wondering how this actually works in practice:

* When longing: Say price is trading at 10,010 and if I am to be filled at 10,000 based on my strategy then the limit order will be placed at 10,000 + spread, thus making it a buy limit at 10,002. The stoploss will be placed (for a 10 point example stop) at 10,002 - 10 - 2 = 9,990.
* When shorting: Say price is trading at 9,990 and if I am to be filled at 10,000 we would sell at the bid. The stoploss would be placed at 10,000 + 10 + 2 = 10,012. The short will be stopped out when the bid reaches 10,010.

I hope that this post was useful to you. I also hope you can all agree that squeezing out more money with our strategies is worth it!

I want to leave you with one question to ask yourself: When was the last time an educator told me to look at my trading costs?

Thank you,

Ali

I can’t accept losses and because of that i can’t make profit it’s that simple. I will close trades at a small loss at breakeven then they will work even if it fits my strategy I just can’t stop closing early. 

My primary feeling this is happening is because I just simply don’t have the money behind me to trade and therefore are putting trading at too much of an importance in my life, therefore every loss I’m scared of as I think I’m a failure. 

I think what I need to do it take a break until I have some good money saved up because at the moment it feels like I’m just too scared to take risks, I’m sure this is the reason. For example if I go shopping, I will buy items just because they are cheaper and this correlates to trading.

We’re at a potentially critical technical spot, and several indicators are worth paying attention to. Here's a breakdown:

# Chart Overview

* **Ticker:** SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
* **Timeframe:** 1 Year Daily
* **Price as of 6/20/25:** $613.97 (up 2.08% on the day)
* **Indicators Used:**
   * Keltner Channels
   * RSI (14)
   * Momentum SMA (28)
   * MACD Histogram (12, 26, 9)

# Technical Breakdown

**Triangle Formation:**  
Price has been in a steady uptrend since the March low and is now nearing the apex of a symmetrical triangle. This was drawn using descending resistance from the January highs and ascending support from the April breakout. A move out of this pattern is likely soon.

**RSI at 62.77:**  
Still in bullish territory but not yet overbought. This leaves room for further upside, but we’re getting closer to the 70 level where pullbacks often occur.

**Momentum SMA at 53.54:**  
Momentum has been strong but recently started to curl down. Still well above the zero line, suggesting buyers are still in control for now, but a shift may be brewing.

**MACD Histogram Positive but Fading:**  
We’re still seeing green on the histogram, but the bars are shrinking. This is often a sign of slowing bullish momentum, which aligns with the idea that a decision point is near.

# Key Levels to Watch

* **Resistance:** \~$615 — the triangle’s upper boundary and recent highs.
* **Support:** \~$575 — the lower trendline.
* **Secondary support:** \~$540 — previous consolidation zone.

# Summary

SPY is pressing up against a major resistance level with momentum and RSI still favoring bulls. If it breaks through with volume, it could trigger a run toward 630–640. If not, a pullback to the 575 range would be a healthy reset. The next couple of sessions could set the tone going into July.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union’s chief trade negotiator said Monday he had “good calls” with Trump administration officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by a July 9 deadline, after Trump agreed to delay his threatened 50% tariff — or import tax — on European goods.

Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on X that the EU’s executive commission was pushing “at pace” towards an EU-U.S. deal and the two sides were in constant contact.

Sefcovic’s calls with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer came a day after Trump said he would delay implementation of the 50% tariff from June 1 until July 9 to buy time for negotiations with the 27-country EU.

That announcement came after Trump’s call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told Trump that she “wants to get down to serious negotiations,” according to the U.S. president on Sunday.

In a social media post Friday, Trump had threatened to impose the 50% tariff on EU goods, asserting that the bloc had been “very difficult to deal with” on trade and that negotiations were “going nowhere.”

The stakes are high given the size of the U.S.-EU trading relationship. Although the trade partners don’t have a free trade agreement like the one the U.S. has with Mexico and Canada, some $1.8 trillion in goods and services cross the Atlantic in both directions each year.

EU Commission spokeswoman Paula Pinho told a news conference that von der Leyen and Trump agreed to “fast-track” the negotiations. The result of the call means that “there is a new impetus for these negotiations, and we will take it from there … from our side, we always said we were ready to make a deal.”

The EU has offered Trump a “zero for zero” deal in which tariffs would be removed on industrial goods including automobiles, but the U.S. administration has said it will not lower tariffs below a 10% baseline imposed on almost all its trading partners.

**Key Takeaways**

Apple shares fell sharply to close out last week after President Trump threatened to impose hefty tariffs on the company if it doesn't manufacture iPhones in the U.S.

The stock has closed lower for eight consecutive sessions and has lost 22% of its value since the start of the year, lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers.

The price recently ran into selling pressure near the upper trendline of a descending broadening formation and the 50-day moving average.

Investors should watch major support levels on Apple's chart around $193 and $169, while also monitoring crucial resistance levels near $215 and $237.

Apple (AAPL) shares will be in the spotlight at the start of the holiday-shortened trading week after falling sharply Friday when President Donald Trump threatened to impose hefty tariffs on the company if it doesn't manufacture iPhones in the U.S.

In a Friday-morning post on Truth Social, Trump said he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones sold in the US must be built in the U.S. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president said.

Trump’s comments were his latest push to ensure that Apple doesn’t expand iPhone production in India as it shifts away from manufacturing in China, which faces among the highest import tariffs of U.S. trading partners. Apple's imports into the U.S. have so far escaped being hit since the Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers and some other consumer electronic devices from ""reciprocal"" tariffs imposed in early April. 

Apple shares dropped 3% on Friday to around $195, losing ground for the eighth consecutive session. The stock has lost 22% of its value since the start of 2025, significantly lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers, as sentiment toward the company has soured due to its significant exposure to tariffs

Below, we take a closer look at Apple’s chart and use technical analysis identify major price levels worth watching out for.

**Descending Broadening Formation in Play**

Since setting their record high in late December, Apple shares have trended lower within a descending broadening formation, with the price tagging the pattern’s upper and lower trendline on several occasions since that time.

More recently, the stock ran into selling pressure near the pattern’s upper trendline and 50-day moving average, which has coincided with the relative strength index falling below its neutral threshold to signal weakening price momentum.

It’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA in early April to form a ""death cross,"" a chart signal that indicates further declines.

Let’s point out major support and resistance levels on Apple’s chart that investors will likely be watching.

**Major Support Levels to Watch**

Further weakness from current levels could see the shares initially fall to around $193. The price may encounter support near this month’s low, which closely aligns with a narrow consolidation period that formed on the chart in the back half of May last year.

The bulls’ failure to successfully defend this level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $169. Investors may seek buy-and-hold entry points in this location near April's prominent low and a brief period of sideways drift before the last May’s stock gap above the 200-day MA.

**Crucial Resistance Levels to Monitor**

Upswings in the stock could see the price initially climb toward $215. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near a trendline that links a range of corresponding peaks and troughs on the chart stretching back to June last year.

Finally, a more-bullish move in Apple shares could fuel a rally to around $237. Investors who bought at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region where notable peaks developed on the chart last July and October.",No paywall Key Takeaways Apple shares fell sharply to close out last week after President Trump threatened to impose hefty tariffs on the company if it doesnt manufacture iPhones in the U.S. The stock has closed lower for eight consecutive sessions and has lost 22% of its value since the start of the year lagging the performance of its Magnificent Seven peers.

Sweden-based Volvo Cars is eliminating 3,000 positions as part of a cost-cutting program as the automotive industry faces challenges from trade tensions and resulting economic uncertainty.

The company said Monday that around 1,200 of the job reductions would come among workers in Sweden, with another 1,000 positions currently filled by consultants, mostly in Sweden, also slated for elimination.

The rest of the job losses would be in other global markets. Most of the jobs being cut are office positions.

“The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars,” said Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars president and CEO.

“The automotive industry is in the middle of a challenging period. To address this, we must improve our cash flow generation and structurally lower our costs.""

The company, owned by China's Geely, has 42,600 full-time employees.

Carmakers around the world are facing several headwinds, among them higher costs for raw materials, a diminished European car market, and U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on imported cars and steel.

I'm French and I keep a close eye on the European markets, particularly to take advantage of the tax benefits we French investors enjoy when investing in them. And today, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but some European stocks are currently experiencing explosive growth:

* On one hand, we have shares of major defense companies like **Rheinmetall**, which is becoming a kind of “European Nvidia” in terms of stock market growth. We can also mention **Leonardo** or **Hensoldt**. Indeed, there’s not only Germany’s €1 trillion defense plan, but also the European Union’s €800 billion investment plan. Among that, a €150 billion package was just approved. And beyond these pure defense players, there are also more generalist companies that are heavily exposed to the defense sector through their activities.
* On the other hand, **small-cap stocks** are also on the rise. Several small caps are landing major contracts that are expected to double or even quintuple their revenues thanks to these investments. Why? Because they produce essential components or services that are in high demand in the defense sector. Moreover, the European plan emphasizes the involvement of small caps to benefit from the funding.

I personally hold stocks that have gained over **+40% in a single week** following the approval of the €150 billion plan, and the trend is still upward.

Now, I know you’re American and maybe not particularly interested in European stocks. But if you are, I’d be happy to share some insights, sources, and information.

Different opinions will mess with your head and your ability to execute with proper risk control, consistency,...

You will compare yourself to better traders and have unrealistic expectations...

You will jump strategies, trading assets and take advice from people who aren't making a single dollar in trading.

My query is:  
How does FTMO make money, because if they have 900,000+ traders, (according to there wbsite in 2021 (obviously a lot of them are in the eval))  
Assuming that at least 25% of that 900000 has a 50k account, which means there would be $45000000000 in equity being circulated.  
How is that real??  
It seems like a scam  
If the equity is not real, then how does the trader (me) make money if I am not trading with real money?

For months, I couldn’t figure out why I’d randomly have blow-up days in the middle of the week.

It didn’t matter what setup I was trading (I have 3 setups) — something always felt off.

📉 Wednesdays were my worst trading days by far.

Here’s why it made sense in hindsight:

Wednesdays were my day off from my 7–5 job.

So I’d sit down and try to act like a full-time trader.

I wanted to make something happen, even if no setup was really there.

And that’s when I’d force trades, chase entries, and size up just to feel productive.

Almost every mistake I made, came from that mindset.

But something else stood out in the data…

📈 Thursdays were some of my best days.

Why?

Because after getting humbled on Wednesday, I’d approach Thursday more focused.

I wasn’t chasing, I was waiting.

Plus, we almost always get red folder news on Thursdays, so there’s actual movement to work with.

Cleaner setups. More discipline. Better results.

Now I’ve made it a rule:

Do real traders those making serious money, thousands or even millions actually post their trades online? Or do they stay quiet, focused, and keep it low-key?

2025-05-28T10:07:42.373717,2025-05-27T16:17:42,investing,1kwof3c,Why the Bond Market is Daddy,"""Watch the bond market, it's the backbone of all markets""

Ray Dalio recently said that in a clip, plugging his new book, ""How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle"" (available for pre-order now, if you're into macroeconomic horror stories)

But that got me thinking... why exactly is the bond market—specifically U.S. Treasuries (Dalio didn't specify, but you can easily read between the lines if you watch the [clip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/anCPsKYgniQ))—such a pivotal force? Why is it spooking so many of our key economic players?

The answer is so simple it almost hurt... US Treasuries give us the 'Risk Free Rate'. Investors normally use the 10-year Treasury Bill to determine the risk free rate (stay away DCF connoisseurs, I'm keeping this simple)

**Why the Market is Freaking Out About Bonds Right Now**

Last Wednesday, the Treasury Department conducted a relatively modest $16 billion auction of 20-year bonds, which saw unexpectedly weak demand. This lack of appetite from investors triggered alarm bells, sending bond yields sharply higher. The critical 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit above 5%—a significant psychological and financial threshold. As a direct consequence, the equity markets swiftly reacted, with the S&P 500 plunging approximately 1.5% within just 30 minutes of the yield spike.

But why such panic over bonds?

At its core, the bond market—specifically U.S. Treasuries—functions as the anchor for borrowing costs throughout the economy. Rising yields indicate increased borrowing costs, which negatively impact everything from mortgages and corporate debt to consumer loans. Higher rates put downward pressure on stock valuations and can slow economic growth significantly.

The backdrop intensifying these concerns is the recent passage of a significant spending bill by the House (the [Big Beautiful Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)), which aims to permanently extend previous tax cuts but at a substantial cost. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this bill could add $3 to $5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Crucially, these projections assume relatively moderate interest rates around 3.6%. Yet, current yields on 30-year Treasuries are already pushing above 5%.

This difference isn’t trivial. Every 1% increase above the CBO's projected rate means roughly an additional $350 billion annually in interest payments. With rates now approximately 1.5% higher than CBO assumptions, the U.S. could face an extra $5 trillion in debt servicing costs over ten years—creating a potentially dangerous cycle of increasing debt and interest obligations.

In short, investors see a growing mismatch between fiscal responsibility and economic reality. The bond market is essentially signaling that ongoing fiscal policies and debt trajectories may be unsustainable. Unless spending patterns shift dramatically, the bond market will likely continue to act as a severe and unforgiving judge of economic policy. The bond market is serving as policymaker's 'economic daddy'.

So, what should we do? I'm not qualified to answer that so I'll tell you what I'm doing... I'm a Buffett-style investor, as most people here are. Buffett treats US Treasuries as his risk-free parking lot. (I currently have \~25% of my portfolio in $SGOV). I'm not anticipating some great change or trying to time anything, but rather, I have dry powder ready to deploy when I find a great company trading at a reasonable price.

We do this because, if we buy a great business with a sustainable moat (with pricing power), we can weather almost any economic storm in the long run-- regardless of US Fiscal policy. A great reference for those interested would be the late 70s/early 80s Berkshire Chairman letters.

What do y'all think of what's going on in the bond market?

While everyone's freaking out about the 53% EPS drop, I've been trying to make sense of why the stock is still up 37% over the same period. Either I'm missing something or the market is.

My position: 120 shares @ $187 average (up about 81% total)

The Q1 earnings were objectively bad

EPS of $0.27 vs expected $0.41 (missed by 34%)

Factory changeovers for Model Y killed production numbers

Automotive margins down to 19% from previous highs in the mid-20s

Musk sounding increasingly distracted on the call

Yet I'm still holding and even added 15 shares on the post-earnings dip. Here's why:

The energy business is quietly becoming a monster

While everyone obsesses over car deliveries, Tesla's energy storage business hit record gross profit with 26% margins. My brother works in commercial solar, and he says Megapack orders are backlogged for months. The margins here are substantially better than automotive, and it's growing faster.

Source: [https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA](https://knkresearchai.com/report/TSLA)

The robotaxi bet could pay off big

I was skeptical about the robotaxi timeline until I saw the Austin test videos. If they actually launch paid rides next month as planned, it changes everything about the valuation model. Even if it's limited geographically, proving the technology works would be massive.

Optimus robot could be the sleeper hit

The Optimus humanoid robot is another wild card that could transform Tesla's business model. They're planning to have thousands of units in production by year-end, ramping to potentially a million units annually by 2030. Imagine having one of these handling household chores, elder care, or factory work. The addressable market is potentially enormous if they can deliver even half of what they're promising.

I've been wrong before, but...

I sold half my position in 2022 thinking the Twitter acquisition would tank Tesla. Cost me about $40K in potential gains when it rebounded. The lesson I learned was that betting against Tesla's long-term vision because of short-term issues has consistently been a losing strategy.

That said, I'm not blind to the risks:

P/E of 171 is insane by traditional metrics

BYD is eating their lunch in China and now Europe

Insider selling has been heavy (Musk, CFO, directors)

The new affordable model keeps getting delayed

Y'all said we are paying too much and suggested to get a low-cost S&P500 fund. I don't see that option, and as y'all can see, there's nothing low-cost here.  What is the best play? The Large Cap Value A?

You can see the percentages. The dollar amount next to it is just the dollar equivalent per $1,000.

2025-05-28T10:07:42.373717,2025-05-27T06:01:23,investing,1kwe00l,Inheritance incoming. Need help.,"Apologies for the long-ish post.

I'm 37. My grandmother recently passed away, and I have 1.1 - 1.2m coming my way. Money got a step up, so I'm capital gains free. I own my house, no real debt.

Currently it's invested with a group at WF that I also inherited from my family. I'm friends with the guy, to some extent, but I also don't love paying them 1% yearly for the level of service we get, which feels very much like a ""we have 3 models - pick one"". 

I'd be open to having a more active role in the management of my own portfolio, but I'm also pretty ignorant as to how to get started and would happily pay a little extra to have some safeguards in place so that I'm not making mistakes (big or small)/missing easy opportunities/etc. 

Fidelity looks a decent option, as does Schwab. But each has an actual ton of options for me to consider, as well.

I make a couple hundred grand a year or more, low car payment. Live in LA, so life is expensive but I can keep that in check usually. 

Just want to grow the money, only dip into it every once in a while if I have to  to make a home improvement or take a trip. 

Any advice?

They’re describing the event as the “first sustainable public equity offering.”

The company has reached a $1.7b valuation in only a few years. And even though Allbirds is hitting huge revenue ($219.3 million in 2020 and rising), the company has yet to see a profitable year.

***\[***[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUm0D4zMh9k) ***on the Allbirds IPO for a breakdown of the full story\]***

**Allbirds Valuation 2021**

Today, Allbirds is one of the most valuable footwear companies globally, with an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. Because of the company’s quick success, Allbirds has received at least $204 million in equity investments from big-name investors.

The company’s revenue in 2020 was $219.3 million, up from $193.7 million the year before. Digital revenue was $194.6 million in 2020. About 53% of 2020 sales were from repeat customers - all of which are great numbers for a business that’s only starting in the market. 

However, at the same time, Allbirds’ losses also grew to $23.6 million from $14.6 million in 2020. For the first six months of 2021, the company had a net loss of $21.1 million, compared to the $9.5 million posted in the same period a year earlier. 

**5 Things to know about Allbirds before they go public** 

1. The Losses Could Continue

With Allbirds’ growth plans come higher operating expenses. This could mean continued losses for the company. And because Allbirds is so heavily focused on sustainability throughout the supply chain, the costs of producing footwear and apparel will increase. 

1. Climate Change Could Affect the Business

Even though Allbirds is focused on addressing climate change, climate change could have a drastic effect on the company’s supply chain and output.

1. Physical Stores Will Increase

Allbirds has identified hundreds of potential locations for new stores - something that the company plans to grow. On top of its current 27 stores, Allbirds is also looking to grow internationally.

1. Supply Chain Issues Could Become a Problem

Allbirds uses various raw materials in its manufacturing process, with most suppliers being outside of the US. There are various risks related to its suppliers and raw material prices. As markets and commodities fluctuate, and international trade issues arise, the business could be affected.

1. The Returns Policy Could be Affecting Revenue

Allbirds offers a 30-day return policy for a full refund or exchange. This is unusual for footwear, and it could be squeezing the company’s revenue. 

The company prospectus states: “Our revenue is reported net of returns, discounts, and any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities”.

“The introduction of new products, changes in customer confidence or shopping habits or other competitive and general economic conditions could cause actual returns to exceed our estimates.”

**Allbirds IPO**

Allbirds has filed for an initial public offering and plans to list on the Nasdaq. The company will have Class A and Class B shares. Allbirds has set a target to raise $100 million from the IPO, but the figures might shift slightly when the time comes. 

All the proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for its growth, which involves acquiring businesses, products, and services in line with their ‘green mission,’ motivating people to invest in the brand on an individual and institutional level.

I have purchased two companies in the past and successfully operated them. In the past, I've used the SBA 7(a) loan to finance my transactions, but my current target won't qualify (for reasons I will detail below).

**The investment:** I'm seeking $1mm-$1.5mm in debt financing from multiple sources. The minimum loan would be $50k. The business' intangible assets and my personal assets would act as collateral. There would also be a personal guarantee. The loan would have a 10% interest rate, be amortized over five years, and have a 30 month balloon payment. No pre-payment penalty. A third-party due diligence firm will complete a quality of earnings report which will be available to prospective investors.

**The target:** The business is an online service company specializing in education. It produces educational videos on a specific topic to a specific demographic. The students do not pay for access to the videos, but are encouraged to purchase products that help with the educational process. These products are sold by third parties and the target company receives a commission for each customer it refers. The company is domiciled in Bulgaria which is why it won't qualify for SBA financing. TTM Revenues are approximately $4.5mm and TTM net profit is $1.75mm. The seller will finance 50% of the purchase price and is therefore highly motivated to ensure the ongoing success of the company.

Is it possible to set a Take Profit for a Stock or Crypto that applies to each position held on that asset? 

For example, Crypto staking rewards are now opening new positions in Cardano(ADA). Every month a new position. After 12 months, 12 new positions and so on. If I want to close all positions when the price hits say, 10 Dollars, do I need to go through all the open positions and set the Take Profit for each one? Or is there a way to set a Take Profit that applies to all open positions for ADA (in this example)? 

TDLR: I'm lazy, want to set a Take Profit for all positions without going to each one individually to set the same amount over and over again

Markets had a surprisingly strong run after the U.S. and China hit pause on their trade tensions. The temporary tariff truce brought a wave of relief to investors, and stocks responded with a sharp bounce. The S&P 500 rallied over 3%, reaching its highest level in weeks.

Big tech names were leading the charge. $AAPL gained momentum, $MSFT remained strong, and $NVDA continued its impressive run. Even $TSLA and $AMZN saw solid upside as risk appetite returned.

With inflation data and Fed signals on the horizon, it’s anyone’s guess how long this rally lasts — but for now, the bulls are back in charge.

**Main Findings**

* Most equity markets have entered or are approaching bear market territory, with the drawdown initially starting in the US due to deteriorating economic conditions and de-rating of large technology companies, before spreading globally following ""liberation day"" and tariff increases.
* The current market downturn appears to be an event-driven bear market (triggered by tariffs), though it could easily transform into a cyclical bear market given the growing recession risk, with economists having raised the recession probability from 15% to 45%.
* Bear market rallies are common during downturns, with data showing these typically last around 44 days with returns of 10-15%, but a sustained recovery requires a combination of cheap valuations, extreme negative positioning, policy intervention, and slowing macro deterioration.
* Current valuations remain expensive by historical standards, particularly in the US, suggesting further downside potential before markets can transition into the ""hope"" phase that marks a new bull market.
* Long-term secular inflection points in the ""Post-Modern Cycle"", including less globalization, higher budget deficits, higher costs of capital, and constraints on corporate profit margins, are likely to weigh on future returns, making a strong case for more portfolio diversification.",GS Research Paper Goldman Sachs Research Bear Market Anatomy The Path and Shape of the Bear Market Main Findings Most equity markets have entered or are approaching bear market territory with the drawdown initially starting in the US due to deteriorating economic conditions and de-rating of large technology companies before spreading globally following liberation day and tariff increases.

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

When Trump recently announced plans to take Fannie and Freddie public, he emphasized that the US government would retain oversight and guarantees even after privatization. These moves are indicative of a hybrid model where the government maintains indirect control and cash flow exposure which is exactly the kind of setup you’d expect if you were preparing to build a sovereign wealth fund structure around these assets.

We’re already seeing other moves that fit this pattern with the recent announced that the US government is looking to secure a golden share in US Steel as part of the Nippon Steel acquisition. They're trying to frame this as a national security safeguard, but I suspect ulterior motives are at play given how it mirrors the way other sovereign wealth funds assert strategic control through equity stakes.

Now if true, this would look very different from other SWFs (such as those in Norway or Saudi Arabia) which are largely funded by natural resources. The US doesn't have that kind of oil-driven surplus to tap into but the idea in theory is built on the same principle that certain public assets should be managed with national interest in mind. However, the differences are crucial and the risks are likely highly underappreciated the market right now. One being that this fund would effectively be supercharged crony capitalism with the state picking winners and directing capital in return for political favors. It’s not a stretch to reach this conclusion given what we’ve already seen. Just take a look at what happened with Bill Owens getting pushed out at 60 Minutes as Paramount executives are looking to gain favor with the Trump administration for approval of its merger with Skydance. The other risk is that the idea of turning public assets into long-term investments might sound appealing on paper to the public but without independent governance and insulation from political meddling, this fund would risk becoming another liability in the form of a national piggy bank.

Part of what has set US markets apart and fueled their long-term outperformance is the openness and decentralized nature of capital allocation. Embedding state-directed investment into the core of America's financial system risks undermining that foundation in ways we may not fully appreciate until it's too late.

America is still an incredibly dynamic and innovative place but this trend (along with declining levels of public trust and growing political instability) are major headwinds.

As far as I understand, this is the first instance of the U.S. government acquiring a golden share, which gives ultimate decision making power to the U.S. government. China makes use of golden shares to prevent certain behaviors in companies that do business in China. 

Key takeaways from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenshare.asp):

- A golden share is a type of share that gives its shareholder veto power over changes to the company's charter.

- One golden share controls at least 51% of voting rights and may be issued by private companies or government enterprises.

- Golden shares have been predominantly used in the United Kingdom as well as Brazil to maintain control over state-run entities.",The US government is poised to receive a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as a condition for approving Nippon Steel Corp.s proposed acquisition of the American company.

2025-05-28T10:07:42.373717,2025-05-27T22:47:35,stocks,1kwydnu,Bloom Energy can ride the AI Boom,"**Bloom Energy (BE) 19.72**

Bloom Energy is an alternative energy producer, using cleaner non-combustion sources for electric generation through utilities and power generators such as American Electric Power, as well as directly to datacenter clients on-site.

It is an interesting and viable business that turned cash flow positive last year, after approximately seven years of operations, growing revenue at an impressive CAGR of 27% from $ 173 million in 2015 to $ 1.5 billion in 2024. It has reached decent gross profit margins of 24% and, with continued scaling likely to reach adjusted operating profits within the next 2 years.

**Positives**

Datacenter demand for electricity is likely to  remain solid as evidenced by the huge Capex plans and spending by hyperscalers on Artificial Intelligence data centers.

This is a fast growing market, which means Bloom is not necessarily dependent only on government incentives for clean power.

Power requirements are estimated to be deficient in the US, and I don’t believe supply will be enough for the next 10 years as datacenter power needs get more and more humongous, especially when it comes to inferencing and reasoning, which is the next level after training, and requires more high-performance GPUs.

Analysts expect a sales growth of over 20% from the current $1.5 billion for the next 3 to 5 years. Similarly adjusted earnings are expected to grow at over 50% from $0.46 to 1.15 in the next two years.

The valuation is a little on the higher side, at about 40 times earnings with 50% growth and 2.7 times sales with 20% growth, but still has room for appreciation for a long term investor, and one can accumulate or average on declines. I've bought some and will average on declines.

**Versatile and Flexible:** Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell technology can use various fuel sources including biogas, natural gas, and hydrogen, and it can be deployed onsite at different locations and supplement energy currently supplied by the grid, thus allowing a data center to function independently.

**Challenges and Negatives**

Bloom has significant client concentration risk with two major clients, American Electric Power and South Korean Electric. 

Also the deal with American Electric for supply of upto 1GW of power is an understanding with a confirmed order of 100 MWh, with an intent to continue adding capacity when needed at clients’ sites or when their own power generation falls short.

Another weakness is that the current administration is not providing any new incentives and even reducing incentives for clean energy.

This is a capital intensive and low margin business and revenue is recognized on project completion and milestones, which will tend to be lumpy.

The departure of the CFO is also not a good sign and could keep a lid on the valuation.

A good GARP - Still given the massive needs of power for data centers in AI this could be an interesting GARP (Growth At a Reasonable Price) around this price as a long-term investment for the next 3-5 years.

I know there are already established nuclear companies that run power plants (vistra, constellation) is there opportunity in this market? With trump signing that order to quadruple nuclear power in the future which companies are innovative/ the future of nuclear tech? These SMRs seem very interesting and the ability to put a couple of them in a data center to power the entire center sounds really interesting to me. I was reading that by 2030 these data centers are expected to drain 20% of the countries power which makes me believe if you are a new start up fusion company and you can figure out how to create massive amounts of energy with the least amount of matter it seems to me you will be in a strong position to make a lot of money. 

Current stocks I am looking at (yes, I am also watching the uranium and nuclear etfs to find exposure that way)

Oklo: develops advanced SMRs with potential to be operational by 2027. Signed a 44 megawatt deal with LV data centers 
Q1 2025 Net Loss: $9.81 million, a significant improvement from a net loss of $24.02 million in the same period of 2024.
	•	Operating Expenses: Totaled $17.87 million, up from $7.37 million in Q1 2024.
	•	Research & Development (R&D): $7.85 million, reflecting increased investment in technology development.
	•	General & Administrative (G&A): $10.03 million, indicating expansion in corporate activities.
	•	Other Income: $3.65 million, primarily from interest and dividend income.

Nuscale: first us company to recieve regulatory approval for their SMRs
Q1 2025 Revenue: $13.4 million, a substantial increase from $1.4 million in Q1 2024. This growth was driven by revenues from the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) Phase 2 project and a Technology License Agreement for the RoPower Doicești power plant in Romania.  ￼
	•	Operating Expenses: Decreased to $42.3 million from $44.6 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs as the company advances toward commercialization.  ￼
	•	Operating Loss: Narrowed to $35.3 million, compared to a loss of $44.0 million in Q1 2024, reflecting improved gross margins and cost management.  ￼
	•	Earnings Per Share (EPS): Reported at -$0.11, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of -$0.17.  ￼
	•	Cash and Short-Term Investments: Ended the quarter with $521.4 million, bolstered by the successful sale of 4.5 million shares through its At-The-Market (ATM) program, generating $102.4 million in gross proceeds.

",I know there are quite a few private fusion companies that these large tech companies are investing in Commonwealth Helion etc I was wondering which nuclearsmr stocks are in the best position to have large market share in powering the data centers of the future. I know there are already established nuclear companies that run power plants vistra constellation is there opportunity in this market With trump signing that order to quadruple nuclear power in the future which companies are innovative the future of nuclear tech These SMRs seem very interesting and the ability to put a couple of them in a data center to power the entire center sounds really interesting to me. I was reading that by 2030 these data centers are expected to drain 20% of the countries power which makes me believe if you are a new start up fusion company and you can figure out how to create massive amounts of energy with the least amount of matter it seems to me you will be in a strong position to make a lot of money.

In recent years, NVIDIA (NVDA) stock has shown a “pullback followed by a strong rebound” pattern driven by two major drivers: on the one hand, a modest overall decline of about 2% since January 2025; on the other hand, since bottoming out in early April, driven by the rebound in demand for AI infrastructure and a number of large trades, the cumulative rebound of about 52%.



From a technical point of view, the daily chart formed a typical “bullish flag” (bullish flag) finishing pattern, implying that the end of the retracement has a greater potential to continue to rise. Above the key resistance levels are located at $ 143 (near February highs) and $ 150; below the initial support can be concerned about the 50-day SMA where the $ 121, and near the historic lows of $ 115. Once the double support is lost, the short-term may be further back to the probe, but if effectively held, it can be regarded as a good layout point

Fundamental level, this Wednesday (May 28) after the plate will be announced the first quarter earnings, the market focus is on:

Whether revenue can grow about 66% year-over-year to $43.3 billion to demonstrate that AI spending is still accelerating;

The true impact of U.S. export restrictions on H20 chips to China, which were previously expected to result in a provision of \~$5.5 billion or so;

The pace of volume production and delivery of Blackwell's next-generation AI hardware. If both revenue and shipments beat expectations, it will further boost the short-term trend



Institutional consensus, 37 Wall Street analysts' latest 12-month average price target of $164.21, implying about 25% upside; high estimate was $200, low estimate is near $100, overall maintain a “Strong Buy” rating.

Comprehensive judgment:

Short-term: high intraday volatility, suggest focusing on long opportunities in the $115-$121 area, or wait for earnings confirmation before intervening;

Medium to long term: Relying on the continuous expansion of AI servers and data centers, and the mass production of Blackwell product line, we can remain structurally bearish.",In recent years NVIDIA NVDA stock has shown a pullback followed by a strong rebound pattern driven by two major drivers on the one hand a modest overall decline of about 2% since January 2025 on the other hand since bottoming out in early April driven by the rebound in demand for AI infrastructure and a number of large trades the cumulative rebound of about 52%.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union’s chief trade negotiator said Monday he had “good calls” with Trump administration officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by a July 9 deadline, after Trump agreed to delay his threatened 50% tariff — or import tax — on European goods.

Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on X that the EU’s executive commission was pushing “at pace” towards an EU-U.S. deal and the two sides were in constant contact.

Sefcovic’s calls with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer came a day after Trump said he would delay implementation of the 50% tariff from June 1 until July 9 to buy time for negotiations with the 27-country EU.

That announcement came after Trump’s call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who told Trump that she “wants to get down to serious negotiations,” according to the U.S. president on Sunday.

In a social media post Friday, Trump had threatened to impose the 50% tariff on EU goods, asserting that the bloc had been “very difficult to deal with” on trade and that negotiations were “going nowhere.”

The stakes are high given the size of the U.S.-EU trading relationship. Although the trade partners don’t have a free trade agreement like the one the U.S. has with Mexico and Canada, some $1.8 trillion in goods and services cross the Atlantic in both directions each year.

EU Commission spokeswoman Paula Pinho told a news conference that von der Leyen and Trump agreed to “fast-track” the negotiations. The result of the call means that “there is a new impetus for these negotiations, and we will take it from there … from our side, we always said we were ready to make a deal.”

The EU has offered Trump a “zero for zero” deal in which tariffs would be removed on industrial goods including automobiles, but the U.S. administration has said it will not lower tariffs below a 10% baseline imposed on almost all its trading partners. Trump has also announced tariffs of 25% on steel and automobiles.",No paywall FRANKFURT Germany AP The European Unions chief trade negotiator said Monday he had good calls with Trump administration officials and the EU was fully committed to reaching a trade deal by a July 9 deadline after Trump agreed to delay his threatened 50% tariff or import tax on European goods.

Investing in a new, more efficient espresso machine.

Debating whether to upgrade our annual ski trip to the Austrian Alps or the Swiss Alps. (The struggle is real.)

I'm building something for investment analysis and need some reality checks from people who actually do this work.

**5 quick questions:**

1. When you research an investment, how many different platforms/sources do you typically check? (Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, company filings, sector reports, etc.)
2. What's the most annoying part of your research process? The thing that makes you go ""ugh, not this again""
3. Have you ever had to tell someone ""let me research that and get back to you"" because pulling the data together would take too long to do on the spot?
4. If you could ask one question and get data from multiple sources automatically (instead of checking each manually), what would that question be?
5. How often do you think ""there has to be a faster way to do this"" during research?

Your answers would be helpful.

Trying to wrap my head around Novo Nordisk’s face-plant. The ADR (NVO) peaked around the $140s last June and now languishes in the mid-60s — a **-50% drawdown** even after today’s little bounce. I’m not seeing a single “Lehman moment,” so what’s really driving the exodus?

A few breadcrumbs I’ve picked up, but none of them *feel* big enough alone:

* **CEO ouster:** Board pushed out long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen this month, blaming the share-price slide and loss of GLP-1 momentum. Succession search is on. 
* **Head-to-head data vs. Lilly:** NEJM study showed Lilly’s Zepbound beating Wegovy for weight-loss efficacy; NVO got clipped another few % that day. 
* **Price-war pressure:** Novo slashed Ozempic/Wegovy list prices after Lilly undercut with $349 direct-sale pricing, sparking worries margins will compress.
* **Growth decel + bearish notes:** Q1 sales still up \~16 % Y/Y but slower than the 30-40 % we saw in 2023; DBS even slapped a *sell* on the name. 

Questions for the hive mind:

1. **Is the market pricing in a long-term erosion of GLP-1 dominance** (manufacturing capacity, oral competitors, price caps)?
2. **Does the CEO switch signal deeper strategic issues** or is it just optics? The Novo Nordisk Foundation still controls the vote.
3. **How bad could margin compression get** if Wegovy/Ozempic turn into a low-price slug-fest?
4. Anyone tracking *pipeline vs. patent cliff* timing here? Is there a sleeper drug that could re-ignite the story like semaglutide did?

The debut is a long-awaited windfall for early investors Atomico, 11.2 Capital, and Insight Partners. It’s the first major public listing of a VC-backed healthtech company since 2021.

But the valuation is sobering for its later investors, another reminder that public markets are still valuing tech stocks at a discount from 2021 highs. Hinge’s last two private financings in January and October 2021 valued the company at $3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Coatue and Tiger Global led both rounds. Hinge stockholders, including Tiger Global and Insight, sold about 5.14 million shares in the IPO.

In Hinge’s public listing, most of the investor-held shares will convert to common stock, but in an unusual move, Tiger elected not to convert some of its preferred shares from the Series E round.

Hinge’s financial position is strong despite the valuation reset from its 2021 heyday. Its first-quarter revenue grew 50% to $123 million, up from $82 million in the first quarter of 2024.

LONG BEACH, Calif., May 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the parent holding company of Geost, LLC (""Geost""), a Tucson, Arizona-based electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) payload development and manufacturing company and provider to high-priority national security satellites, from Lightridge Solutions, a portfolio company of ATL Partners, for $275 million in a mix of $125 million of cash and $150 million in privately placed shares of Rocket Lab common stock, plus up to $50 million in potential additional cash earnout payments tied to revenue targets. The acquisition marks Rocket Lab’s formal entry into the satellite payload segment, strengthening the Company’s position as a provider of end-to-end national security space solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

With more than 20 years of flight heritage across classified and unclassified missions, Geost delivers advanced EO/IR sensor systems for missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness—core capabilities for achieving the U.S. Department of Defense’s goals for resilient, proliferated space architectures, like the proposed Golden Dome architecture and the Space Development Agency’s Tracking Layer.

By bringing these mission critical payloads in-house, Rocket Lab enhances its ability to rapidly deliver integrated spacecraft systems purpose-built for U.S. national security, while reducing integration risk, reducing costs, and accelerating timelines. Geost’s full suite of sensing solutions enables warfighters and mission operators to protect, defend, and execute with speed and precision in increasingly contested space environments.

The acquisition adds Optical Systems as a new category within Rocket Lab’s deep portfolio of capabilities, cementing the Company’s role as a disruptor in national security space.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: ""Rocket Lab was founded to disrupt the traditional space industry and we’re doing just that by expanding our ability to deliver complete, mission-critical space solutions. With the acquisition of Geost, we’re bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale. These technologies enable spacecraft that can detect, interpret, and respond to threats in real time, enhancing our role as a trusted provider of end-to-end space capabilities for the United States and its allies—with greater speed, intelligence, and operational control.""

I've been experimenting with a basic options trading strategy in QuantConnect and wanted to get your thoughts.

The idea is simple:  
When QQQ drops more than 1% from the previous day's close, I buy 1 near-the-money call option (20–40 DTE).  
I'm selecting the call that's closest to ATM and has the earliest expiry in that window.

The logic is based on short-term overreactions and potential bouncebacks. I'm using daily resolution and only buy one option per dip to keep things minimal.

Here’s the simplified logic in code:

    pythonCopyEditif dip_percentage >= 0.01 and not self.bought_today:
        chain = data.OptionChains[self.option_symbol]
        calls = [x for x in chain if x.Right == OptionRight.Call and x.Expiry > self.Time + timedelta(20)]
        atm_call = sorted(calls, key=lambda x: (abs(x.Strike - current_price), x.Expiry))[0]
        self.MarketOrder(atm_call.Symbol, 1)

The strategy works decently in short bursts, but over longer periods I notice drawdowns get pretty ugly, especially in choppy or slow-bear markets where dips aren't followed by strong recoveries.

* **Start Equity:** $100,000
* **End Equity:** $1,256,795.27
* **Net Profit:** \+1156.80%
* **Compounding Annual Return (CAR):** 28.28%
* **Max Drawdown:** 59.20%
* **Total Orders:** 221
* **Portfolio Turnover:** 14%
* **Total Fees:** $100.01

**Would love any tips or ideas on how to:**

* Reduce drawdowns
* Add basic filters (e.g., trend confirmation, volatility)
* Improve entry/exit logic (e.g., profit targets, time stops)

Has anyone tried something similar or have suggestions to make this more robust?

**What I have already tried:**

* **Selection Logic:**
   * Prefer **In-The-Money (ITM)** options (delta ≥ 0.6).
   * Choose **20–40 DTE** options.
   * Avoid **high IV** (implied volatility < 0.3).
* **Risk Management:**
   * Limit risk to **1–2%** of capital per trade.
   * Use **VIX filter** (don’t trade if VIX > 28).
   * Only trade when **QQQ > 200 SMA**.
   * **Cooldown period**: Wait 5 days between trades.
   * Exit after **7 days or 50% profit**, whichever comes first.

Really really happy with the work i've done on this   
In sample data was till the end of 2020   
And Out of Sample 2021 onwards  
Pitched this today as well to two funds as well which went well as well 

The overall strategy has one trend following strategy added to it  
Example : If we're going long on EURUSD we go short on GBPUSD as a method of decreasing overall noise in the equity curve , but making sure the trending element of the strategy also has some edge to it.

The pair selection also has been done elegant way building a correlation matrix of all the pairs and choosing the most diversified low spread pairs as possible which have the highest % of mean reversion

There we lot of pairs which has really high %'s of mean reversion but these pairs we're all ones with high spreads and low volume , i've ignored them example i've found from my testing USDILS mean revert 65% of the time , which means 65-35 = it gives us an edge of 30% per year but i've still not included them in the backtest as i've never traded them completely want to remove any selection bias. 

These pairs can be included in the future or worked upon later.  
  
\- The strategy runs with absolutely no parameters   
\- It runs on a simple 1:1RR system with no risk management rules ( again as i wanted the backtest as raw as possible ( lot for more scope for further improvement )   
\- The backtest has only a few hundred trades a year   
\- Also keeping in mind a reverse of ( 20% for shocks , management fee , extra costs )

Do you think the best thing to do is to program the strategy and add a SL training that makes it stay X pips away from the price always without retracing (I would get this data by optimizing it automatically)?

You can structure 50/50 bets, or better, or worse, depending on your risk appetite and opinion on the underlying, and then inevitably go broke much like a loser at a roulette table doubling his bet several times and losing his shirt in the end. Or, is this just an old wives' tale and you can actually use the martingale process and options in your trading to make outsized returns?

What is a martingale in finance? A martingale process refers to any process that is random. In finance and derivatives pricing, all model building starts with the martingale assumption that the chance of an asset being up or down in the next period is 50/50. This is a simple concept, but many people do not get it because they are used to reading about martingales in gambling context and literature.

In gambling, a martingale is a ""bankroll strategy"" where you start betting an amount on even odds, like black or red on roulette, and if you lose, then you double your bet in the next round, hoping that you will win and that you will not only recover your bets but also make the initial expected profit from the losing round. Theoretically this is a wining ""strategy"" but only if the casinos do not impose table limits and only if you have an unlimited bankroll to survive the inevitable losing streaks. These limitations are what gives the casino an additional edge in the game, and what leads the gamblers to 100% losses.

So, given that your bankroll as a trader is limited, and there is no practical ""table"" limit in the market...and what if the odds are better than 50/50 and you have additional information that the odds are in your favor, much counting all cards in blackjack and toward the end of the shoe playing large bets with perfect strategy? Under these circumstances, you need to calculate your edge, and therefore your bet size, to maximize the return from the trades using the Kelly criterion or some other method. Gambling is all of a sudden ""reframed"" and it might make rational sense to do it. This type of gambling is not allowed in any casino, so just think on that for a moment.

I will trade several option strategies in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for my public experimenting with small and hopefully growing bets. Some strategies which I will use are:

1. SPX option spreads
2. Vertical spreads including iron condors
3. Butterfly and calendar spreads
4. Inversing unusual option trades

I will start trading several of these strategies at the same time, so I will do my best to stay on top and track everything in a spreadsheet, and as always I will post my trading records as well. Not here because that violates the journaling rule, but in my profile and sub.

Everyone who is interested in following along and learning is welcome!

I’d love to hear your set ups and get as granular as you want because I think all of us here geek out on this stuff.

I was maxing out my previous computer and definitely maxed out my RAM and storage so I just bought a brand new Mac studio M4 Max 40 core, 128 gb memory, and total storage internal and external is 15 TB. 

I’m simply using pycharm for IDE, mysql database with dbeaver and my database is only about 2TB. Now that I have more space I will definitely be filling it up.

My strategy is relatively simple and I just find volatility dislocations to short options. So I have been vacuuming up historical options, data as my previous system allowed. But now with this new system, I’m prepared to get a lot of intraday option data because I was previously limited to EOD data. 

I’ve also built some mid-level complexity, probability analysis on top of all my data.

My Algo return per year is only 6% but when I add in discretionary that bumps up to nearly 20%. I have been slowly automating on my discretionary trading and I will keep bumping that 6% up. 

My computer has been completely automated so it starts itself, runs all programs and live trades and then turns itself off after everything is complete at the end of the day. 

Backups: I use Time Machine with no exclusions and also automatically back up my entire mysql database every day.

I’m not gonna pretend I’m some 50% a year MIT quant but I’ve steadily gotten better and will continue to do so.

Would love to hear about all of your infrastructure and data.

Hey all,

I’m looking ahead at retirement but still want to actively trade stocks/options. Curious what states people think are best for that kind of setup—especially places with **no state income tax**.

I’ve been considering **Nevada, Florida, and Tennessee**, but each seems to come with trade-offs:

* **Nevada** has no tax, but the water situation seems rough if you’re into land or even just having a pond.
* **Florida** is tax-free too, but insurance costs (especially homeowners) are sky high from what I hear.
* **Tennessee** seems like the best middle ground—no income tax, lower cost of living, and you can still get decent land + internet if you’re outside the cities.

Assuming that at least 25% of that 900000 has a 50k account, which means there would be $45000000000 in equity being circulated.

Like, your plan says “cut it,” but your brain goes, “Nah, maybe it’ll bounce.” So you stare at the screen, hoping, reasoning, bargaining. And next thing you know, it’s down twice as much and you’re still holding because *now it’s really too late to close, right?*

I’ve been thinking a lot about *why* we do this. And turns out, it’s not just weak discipline or bad habits. It’s literally how our brains are wired.

There’s this concept called **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky)  basically, losses hurt *a lot* more than gains feel good. Like, psychologically, losing $100 feels worse than gaining $100 feels good. We’re hardwired to avoid pain more than we chase reward.

So when a trade goes red, closing it means *accepting that pain*. And that’s exactly what the brain resists. It tells us to wait. “It’ll turn around.” “Don’t give up yet.” But in reality? That delay usually makes it worse.

I’ve seen this so many times not just in myself, but in literally every trader I’ve talked to. You hesitate once, and suddenly you're deep in the hole, no plan, just vibes and stress.

Some people fix it by automating their stops. Others just force themselves to journal every trade, especially the losing ones, so they can look back and say: “Okay, I followed my rules here. It was just a bad setup. Next.”

Honestly? Just *realizing* that this hesitation is normal that it’s your brain trying to protect your ego helps a ton. You can catch the moment and go: “Wait. This is that thing. That avoidance. But I’ve been here before. Let’s cut it.”

Curious if anyone else deals with this the same way. Like, do you also get that weird freeze when it’s time to exit a loser? Or have you figured out a mental trick to just follow the damn plan?",Ever had a trade hit your stop-loss but you just couldnt close it Like your plan says cut it but your brain goes Nah maybe itll bounce.

Now as I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong, if a stock has a large day's to cover this presents a very big risk to short sellers as they might get squeezed when they try to cover their short and incur very big losses.

1. Webull says the days to cover are 1 and have been so for a long time for SYTA. Would that be a huge short risk red flag for you?

2. What is considered a large days to cover?

As you can see in the image above, we are witnessing more than just a little pump in price, we are witnessing how Ethereum's ecosystem keeps growing non stop and coming more alive than ever and data is here to prove it.

For example, active addresses are holding around 15 million which is a strong indicator that more users are interacting with the network and not just speculating with it. (Some will say here that they are a few persons with multiple wallets, FUDers)

Regarding multi chain users, they have increased by 9.4% hitting 617k. This showing again that people are not sticking to one chain and they are enjoying and exploring the broader Ethereum Universe from Arbitrum to Base to zkSync, etc.

Furthermore, Layer 2 dominance is up 5.8% showing that more activity is migrating off the mainnet on to efficient cost effective rollups. This is really good for scaling and its a sign of real adoption.

As you can see, Ethereum ecosystem is more alive than ever and its aligning perfectly with the current bullish momentum. This is not just whales playing games, this is organic growth happening under the hood. We are witnessing Ethereum evolution.

I came to the experts to ask about a friend who recently got into crypto and explained to me something who raised red flags. Please excuse any error on my part, I'm not a crypto bro, just a concerned friend.

So my friend was advised by another friend of him that he met online (supposedly a while ago and definitely not a scammer...).

That guy explained to him something called smart contract mining and that he could win passive income.

So he showed me his apps and explained the steps he was instructed to take. He installed an app called Bitget wallet. He set up a wallet and bought ETH on it. He then transferred it to USD tokens ? (Why not start with those? Is he not paying transactions ?)

Then there is like an internet browser inside that app, and on there he goes to a website. That can see all is capital from his wallet ! Is this normal ? And apparently his capital is used to mine ETH, and he talked about profits that seems way too much. Apparently he could withdraw anytime ?

He did have to give some sort of access to the miner site, but couldn't tell me 100% that the access is safe. 

Is he right to trust his friend  and the app/site/whole process or is this a scam ? Should I stop him? I never seen him mention that kind of money before and I'm afraid he will loose it.

Also for clarification the money shown in the capital on the site is also still shown in his app capital.

2025-05-28T10:07:42.373717,2025-05-27T18:45:28,CryptoCurrency,1kws5g8,USDC or Lightning?,"I’ve been following the rollout of **Steak n Shake’s new Bitcoin terminals** (which is wild, honestly) and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X (Twitter) about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businesses—particularly small businesses.

On one hand, we’ve got the **Lightning Network**, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster, cheaper transactions. On the other hand, there are **stablecoins** like **USDC** (which major payment processors like **Stripe** and **Square Pay** have signaled support for). This begs the question: **if you’re a small business owner, which option makes more sense?**



Here’s the debate as I see it at this point:

**⚡ Lightning Network**

* Pros: Near-instant transactions with super low fees (we’re talking fractions of a cent). It’s directly tied to Bitcoin, which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also, there’s the narrative that “Bitcoin is sound money,” and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC.
* Cons: Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. There’s also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself, which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow.

**💵 Stablecoins (like USDC)**

* Pros: Stablecoins offer price stability (1 USDC = $1), which businesses love. Plus, big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers, paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin.
* Cons: Depending on how payments are handled, there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also, stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC, for example, has been through some ups and downs with market perception.



**Why does this matter?**

For small businesses—think your local coffee shop, indie retailer, or service provider—the decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isn’t just about technical features. It’s about **ease of use**, **customer demand**, **fees**, **regulatory compliance**, and the potential **future-proofing** of their payment systems.

As far as I can tell, both **Stripe** and **Square** are moving toward supporting **both Lightning and stablecoins**, so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now, adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities, whereas **USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms**.

Personally, I think we’ll see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term, since they’re more aligned with how people already think about money. **Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction.**

I’m curious what the /cryptocurrency community thinks. **If you ran a small business and had to choose between accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments or stablecoins like USDC, which would you pick and why?** Are there other options I should be considering?



Also, if anyone has experience using either in a real-world business, I’d love to hear about your experience.

  
[https://cryptostrategygroup.com/stablecoins-or-lightning/](https://cryptostrategygroup.com/stablecoins-or-lightning/) ",Ive been following the rollout of Steak n Shakes new Bitcoin terminals which is wild honestly and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X Twitter about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businessesparticularly small businesses. On one hand weve got the Lightning Network a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster cheaper transactions. On the other hand there are stablecoins like USDC which major payment processors like Stripe and Square Pay have signaled support for. This begs the question if youre a small business owner which option makes more sense Heres the debate as I see it at this point Lightning Network Pros Near-instant transactions with super low fees were talking fractions of a cent. Its directly tied to Bitcoin which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also theres the narrative that Bitcoin is sound money and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC. Cons Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. Theres also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow. Stablecoins like USDC Pros Stablecoins offer price stability 1 USDC $1 which businesses love. Plus big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin. Cons Depending on how payments are handled there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC for example has been through some ups and downs with market perception. Why does this matter For small businessesthink your local coffee shop indie retailer or service providerthe decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isnt just about technical features. Its about ease of use customer demand fees regulatory compliance and the potential future-proofing of their payment systems. As far as I can tell both Stripe and Square are moving toward supporting both Lightning and stablecoins so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities whereas USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms. Personally I think well see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term since theyre more aligned with how people already think about money. Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction. Im curious what the cryptocurrency community thinks.

As a beginner, there are just so many different directions to go in, and I’m not sure which one is the best for me. I’ve seen so many people talk about how they wished they started investing or building something earlier, and I really don’t want to miss the opportunity to set myself up for the future. I just thought that if I start now while I’m young, it could really help me out financially when I’m older.

Starting a business sounds exciting to me because I’d love to build something of my own, but I’m not exactly sure where to begin. There are tons of different business ideas out there—some people make money online through freelancing or selling digital products, while others start small local services or even build apps and websites. I want to create something valuable, but I don’t have a ton of experience yet, and the learning curve feels steep.

At the same time, I’ve also been really curious about crypto. I’ve heard stories of people who invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum early and made huge returns, and even though I know it’s risky, it still feels like something I should understand and possibly get involved in. But then again, there are so many coins, wallets, exchanges, and scams out there that I don’t want to make a mistake and lose money. It’s hard to know who to trust or how much to invest without feeling like I’m gambling.

I’m trying to think long-term. I’m not trying to get rich overnight or jump on the next hype train. What I really want is a smart way to start now—whether it’s through slowly building a business or gradually learning how to invest—and then grow from there. I’m okay with starting small. I just need a bit of guidance so I can make better decisions and not waste time or money on something that’s not right for me.

If anyone has experience with this kind of thing—starting a business as a beginner, or getting into crypto the smart way—I’d really appreciate any advice you’re willing to share. I’m open to both paths right now, and maybe I’ll end up doing a bit of both. But I just want to be sure I’m not rushing in blind, and that I’m setting a strong foundation for whatever I decide to pursue.

I see many influencers and market makers hyping Bitcoin as digital gold. But we need to recognize that Bitcoin is a man-made creation. A future breakthrough, perhaps a revolutionary technology could eventually decrypt it. With the rapid advancement of AI and quantum computing, it’s only a matter of time before malicious actors find a way to hack Bitcoin.

Moreover, no nation-state will ever allow Bitcoin to replace its fiat currency. Doing so would mean surrendering control over its citizens. While now might seem like a good time to invest in Bitcoin, it’s important to stay cautious and not get swept up in influencer-driven hype. Remember, what goes up eventually comes down.

Personally, I’d rather invest in a solid altcoin with real utility and actual use cases.",I see many influencers and market makers hyping Bitcoin as digital gold.

“What would your future self tell you to do right now?”

At the time, I brushed it off. But over the years — and definitely in crypto — that question started to hit different.

Because let’s be real, this space is wild. One minute you’re up 3x, the next you’re stuck bagholding some alt that lost all volume. Then there’s the news cycles, CT drama, rotating narratives, and FOMO everywhere. Easy to lose the plot.

So I started asking myself that same question before every move I made:

Would future-me thank me for this trade? This hold? This decision to do nothing?

Sometimes that meant cutting a loser early — even if I liked the project.
Other times it meant holding longer than was comfortable — because the setup was right.
And often, it meant not doing anything when the market was a chopfest.

The real shift? I stopped pretending every little pump or dump mattered. I started focusing on positions with intent, not just movement.

So here’s the ask — same one that got me years ago:
What would your future self want you to fix or change right now?
Whether it's your risk management, your entries, your research habits, your time in front of the screen — put it out there in the comments.

Sometimes just writing it down shifts your perspective.
Let’s hear it.

The numbers speak for themselves:
	•	Over 2,500 early investors already involved
	•	60M+ potential end users
	•	90% of pre-seed tokens staked for 18 months — a strong indicator of long-term commitment

Early participants are also offered an exclusive 10% bonus, which adds a smart incentive to act before the public rollout.

2025-05-28T10:07:42.373717,2025-05-27T18:27:52,CryptoMarkets,1kwrpfb,Kaspa will SHOCK people!,"Kaspa is on the verge of transforming the smart contract landscape with the upcoming integration of EVM compatibility and ZK Rollups — a move that positions it as the most revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain since Bitcoin. But unlike Ethereum and most modern chains, Kaspa isn't just adding features — it's doing so without compromising the very principles that crypto was built on.

Where Ethereum has become plagued with MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks — allowing bots to manipulate transactions for profit — Kaspa is inherently MEV-resistant. Its blockDAG architecture and rapid block propagation neutralize the opportunities for these attacks, preserving transaction fairness and integrity.

More importantly, Kaspa does not rely on centralized validators, a flaw that has turned many proof-of-stake networks like Solana and Sui into quasi-corporate blockchains. Kaspa stays true to Bitcoin’s ethos: fully decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. With its pure proof-of-work model, no party — not even developers or insiders — can prioritize or block your transactions.

The addition of EVM smart contracts and ZK Rollups on top of this ultra-decentralized foundation is unprecedented. It brings programmability and scalability to a truly neutral, trustless system — something no other network offers today.

In a sea of compromised Layer 1s, Kaspa stands alone. When smart contracts go live, it won’t just be another blockchain — it will be the only one where decentralization, speed, and programmability coexist without trade-offs. That’s not just innovation. That’s a revolution.


Why EVM and ZK Rollup Smart Contracts on Kaspa Will Be Game-Changing

The integration of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollup technology with Kaspa’s uniquely decentralized architecture is poised to deliver one of the most revolutionary breakthroughs in blockchain history. This isn’t just an upgrade—it’s a foundational shift that merges the power of smart contract logic with the fastest, most secure, and MEV-resistant layer-1 network ever built.

To understand the magnitude of this transformation, we must first break down the components.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the core engine behind Ethereum’s smart contracts. It allows developers to write decentralized applications (dApps) using languages like Solidity and deploy them across the Ethereum network. This functionality unlocked the DeFi and NFT revolutions. Now, by bringing EVM compatibility to Kaspa, developers can seamlessly port Ethereum-based apps onto a radically superior blockchain without rebuilding them from scratch—retaining the same language, tooling, and ecosystem, but gaining vastly improved speed, scalability, and decentralization.

ZK Rollups, on the other hand, are a powerful scaling solution that processes thousands of transactions off-chain and then verifies them with a single cryptographic proof on-chain. The ""zero-knowledge"" aspect ensures that these verifications do not reveal private transaction data, offering both scalability and privacy. In Ethereum, ZK Rollups are essential to easing congestion and cutting gas fees. But Kaspa takes this further: with its blockDAG architecture that already enables sub-second block times and high throughput, ZK Rollups will amplify Kaspa’s scalability to near-infinite levels, without compromising its security or decentralization.

Now combine these elements with Kaspa’s unique advantages—true decentralization with no central validators, a network that’s inherently MEV-resistant, and the closest architecture to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work ethos—and you have the blueprint for a platform that may finally solve the blockchain trilemma: achieving decentralization, scalability, and security simultaneously.

When Kaspa rolls out EVM-compatible ZK smart contracts, the crypto world will witness an unstoppable fusion of Ethereum's rich dApp ecosystem, ZK technology’s efficiency and privacy, and Kaspa’s unmatched decentralization and speed. This will not only level the playing field for developers—it will redefine what’s possible in finance, governance, gaming, and beyond.

In short: this isn't just an upgrade to smart contracts.

* CEX/DEX inflow and outflow tracking
* Wallet tracking and analysis
* Smart money/whale wallet scanners
* Multi-chain support
* Early project discovery capabilities

Hey everyone 👋 — I’m researching how people turn early-stage ideas into actual products (apps, websites, tools, etc).

If you’re a developer, designer, indie hacker, or startup founder — I’m curious:
	•	How do you usually research or plan before you build?
	•	Where do you personally get stuck?
	•	If you could automate or simplify one part of that messy early process, what would it be?

I’m not selling anything — just trying to understand real workflows and pain points. Would love to hear your process (or your frustrations).

I bought it at a 20% discount below market value because I got it from a grand parent. He told me to look the cheapest in the area and discount 20% off and that would be the price. What a slam dunk, right?

Five years in, I tried to sell. My realtor told me to leave it empty because “rented homes take longer to sell.” So I left it vacant. A full year. No rent. Just sitting there. Eventually, frustrated, I rented it out again for two more years.

Fast forward to now: I just sold it. And to my luck (again) I sold it for more than what new properties in the area are going for, even though this apartment is 13 years old.  It was even above what my agent said I could ever get. So I bought at the lowest price possible, and I sold at the highest price possible.


I did my numbers and still I lost money.

How?

1. Appreciation was a myth. The so-called “gain” barely beat inflation, and certainly didn’t compensate for the time, risk, or more importantly opportunity cost.


2. Vacancy and maintenance wasn't hell but hurt my returns. I lost rental income for a year, because market wasn't active when I wanted to sell. paid fees, taxes to buy, taxes to keep and taxes to sell. 


Now here’s where Bitcoin comes in.

I have been buying Btc since 2017. Haven't sold any. But have invested peanuts Compared to this apparment. With btc, I don’t deal with broken pipes or flaky tenants. I don’t need a real estate agent to “convince” someone to overpay.

With Bitcoin, I own it. It’s mine. It’s liquid. It’s borderless. It doesn’t age, it doesn’t rot, and I can send it in a second to anyone in the world. And despite the volatility, I’ve never lost sleep over it the way I have over real estate.

I’m 35 now, and feel like I lost 8 years of financial race in this stupid play. 

I learned this lesson the hard way, but I share it in case someone else is being told the same myths I was when younger. Real estate is not always the safe bet they make it out to be. And for me, Bitcoin makes a hell of a lot more sense.

I will now dump all the proceeds to multiply my stats, even at the all time high. And will surely sleep like a baby tonight

Most of the time it is not capital. It is not speculation. It is people. People who explain the idea before it is popular. People who make tools or fix bugs without being asked. People who translate, design, write, moderate, connect. These early contributors often build the surface area that the rest of the system eventually stands on.

But when value arrives, they are rarely part of it. They are either forgotten or remembered informally. There is no reliable way to track contribution or reward it with any structure. Unless you were part of the founding group or already close to the token, you are usually left out.

We have Proof of Work. We have Proof of Stake. We even have Proof of Attendance. But we do not have anything like Proof of Growth. Nothing that tries to formally recognize who helped a protocol grow in its earliest and most fragile moments.

I am wondering if that is even possible. Can growth be measured? Can contribution be recorded without turning it into a bounty system or a grant application? Can it happen on-chain, without relying on social memory or central teams?

1. Why does it needs the bisect game in fraud proof?
2. Why can the transactions in the rollup be fast?

Ok for the bisect game, I saw on l2beats that Arbitrum, base and op stack are all using bisect for their fraud proof. I can't understand why, isn't a fraud easily proven by just executing all the transactions and provide the needed l2 state? If that's too much gas for a single l1 block, the challenger can split it themselves, right? I don't see why it needs an interactive bisect game.

For the second, I know that withdrawing to l1 needs several days for the state to be challenged. However, why isn't it also apply to transactions within the rollup? If I transfer money to another account, and later that block got challenged successfully, then my transfer doesn't count, right? So I don't understand how my transfer can be settled before the block itself got settled.

That's all, thanks in advance!",Let me first list the two questions that bothers me recently 1. Why does it needs the bisect game in fraud proof 2.

Today was my first day back at work.. thought it would keep my mind busy, but it was the opposite. I didn't want to be there, so I started thinking of where I wanted to be: at home or at the park, hanging out with my boy.

I know time is the ultimate healer, but this is the toughest anything I've been through in my life. 

I repeat to myself that he's in a better place now, no longer in pain, and has all the steak he can possibly eat.. but I can't pysch myself up no matter what I do. This hurt is so bad, I feel like I'm on autopilot, no energy or drive. 

I've never asked for folks to reach out and say something nice, but if you got any advice, words of wisdom, whatever, I'd appreciate it. 

If you're wondering, he was completely surrounded by his family the whole morning up until the vet, ate steak and laid under some shade. Then my brother and I were with him until the end. He went peacefully. I did my best to make his last days as comfortable as possible.

AMA!,"Just wanted to share something that's been working really well for me. I've been consistently profitable recently, and it's all thanks to focusing on just two core strategies:

1. **The 15-Minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB):** This one is my bread and butter for catching those initial explosive moves right after the open.
2. **The Falling Wedge Breakout:** Super reliable for spotting reversals and getting in on new trends.

What's cool is that even on those notoriously tough days – you know, the big gap-ups or the ones where the market just chops around like crazy – these two strategies have kept me in the green. It's been a game-changer for my trading.

I'm happy to chat about them, answer questions, or even just share my general approach.

Analysts have targets up to $175, with an average around $118, about 45% upside. With strong growth and expansion plans, I feel like this dip looks like a solid long-term call opportunity. 

Thinking about a $100C exp 1/16/26 to give it more time to rebound. CAVA doesn’t get a lot of noise, so going shorter feels risky. Although, there’s a $90C exp 7/18 going for cheap that looks interesting, but worry theta could eat into it fast if it doesn’t reach breakeven soon enough.

I’m still new to this—got a bit ahead recently trading 0dte SPX calls and figured it might be smart to shift strategies while I’m ahead. Looking to use LEAPS more as a stock replacement strategy to stay long but limit risk.

Trade Details
Underlying Asset: SPY Call Option

Strike Price: 589

Buy Time: 10:51

Purchase Price: $0.60 × 25 contracts = $1,500 (total cost)

Sell Time: 14:40

Sell Price: $2.03 × 25 contracts = $5,075 (total proceeds)

Net Profit: $5,075 - $1,500 = $3,575 (around $3,539.78 after fees)

Return on Investment: 116.6%

Market Context
The current market is highly volatile. As an ETF tracking the S&P 500 Index, SPY is influenced by various factors, including macroeconomic data, corporate earnings seasons, and Federal Reserve monetary policy expectations. Recent economic data has been mixed, and corporate earnings results have been inconsistent, leading to significant market sentiment fluctuations. The heightened implied volatility of options presented an opportunity for this trade.

Trading Logic
Strike Price Selection
The 589 strike price was chosen based on an expectation of short-term upward movement in the S&P 500 Index. This strike price fell within a reasonable range of being either in-the-money or out-of-the-money, offering a good balance between the probability of profit and cost control.

Entry Timing
After observing market sentiment and key indicators (such as trading volume, sector performance, and economic data releases) during the morning session, I judged that there was upward momentum and entered the trade at 10:51.

Exit Strategy
When the option price reached my target level during the late afternoon, I exited the position at 14:40 to lock in profits, avoiding potential pullbacks from market volatility.

Reflections and Suggestions
Options are high-risk, high-reward trading tools. While they can provide opportunities for quick profits, accurately assessing market trends is crucial. A misjudgment can result in losing the entire premium. Therefore, setting clear stop-loss and take-profit levels and aligning trades with your risk tolerance is essential for effective options trading.

Risk Disclaimer
This review is for sharing purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. Options trading carries extremely high risk and may result in the loss of the entire premium. Please trade cautiously based on your risk capacity.

**SPX and XSP Pair Trade Strategy:**

Sell an in-the-money (ITM) call credit spread on SPX at the 50-delta (ATM), and simultaneously enter the exact opposite position—a matching ITM put credit spread—on XSP at the 50-delta, both with the same strike width (e.g., $5) and expiration (three days out). The objective is to collect over $2.50 in premium on each leg. If the total credit received exceeds $5 (the width of the spreads), wouldn’t this effectively create a low-risk setup with limited downside and potential arbitrage-like characteristics?

Why Long $TSLA - Technical Analysis Logic

When I got involved on May 22, $TSLA had just completed a nice multiple support confirmation:

On the daily chart, TSLA tested the support in the 320-325 range 3 times at the beginning of the month (typical triple bottom pattern).

The RSI has bounced back from oversold to above 50, with momentum turning stronger.

The 5-day SMA broke through the 10-day SMA, signaling a golden cross.

Volume is enlarged, indicating that the main force is starting to enter the market.

Why sell at $19.25? Discipline is not to be greedy

I know some may say “you should have held to 25 or even 30”, but my choice at the time was motivated by the following:

342.5 is the strike price of the entire contract, and TSLA is approaching 350, slowing down the option upside.

IV (implied volatility) had spiked, and holding it any longer time decay ate it up faster

Technically touched pre-daily resistance near 355, and there are signs of stalling intraday

Pre-disc news more favorable to cash, news reversal risk increases

I'm not dreaming, I'm trading. Falling out of the bag, discipline is greater than fantasy.

Next plan: watch for potential breakout levels in $NVDA, $AMD, and $META, and get ready to get another vote!

**As a general rule: ""NEVER"" EXERCISE YOUR LONG CALL!**   
A common beginner's mistake stems from the belief that exercising is the only way to realize a gain on a long call. It is not. Sell to close is the best way to realize a gain, almost always.       
**Exercising throws away [extrinsic value](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) that selling retrieves.**   
**Simply sell your (long) options, to close the position, to harvest value, for a gain or loss.**  
**Your break-even is the cost of your option when you are selling.**  
**If exercising (a call), your breakeven is the strike price plus the debit cost to enter the position.**

**As another general rule, don't hold option trades through expiration.**

Expiration introduces complex risks that can catch you by surprise. Here is just one [horror story](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ipqkua/fridays_tsla_lesson_close_positions_before/) of an expiration surprise that could have been avoided if the trade had been closed before expiration.

I opened the position because I was bearish on TSLA, and also saw it as a partial hedge.

Now Tesla has surged upward unexpectedly, and I’m unsure how to proceed. My maximum loss is $3.70, which is essentially already reached — in fact, closing the position now would cost even more due to the current spread.

The thing is, I’m still bearish on TSLA. So my question is: how should I defend this position?

It’s clearly gone against me, and with a cost basis of $1.30, I’ve pretty much hit the max loss already. Should I just wait and hope TSLA drops before expiration, or should I roll it to a later expiration or higher strikes?

As an options trader, we start by thinking we’re going to make fast easy money. We quickly learn that is likely not to be the case. The next step, is to humble ourselves, and aim low enough. Sounds weird but in this context if you embrace aiming low enough you might make it. 

As a new options trader, there are a LOT of things you need to focus on. Saving. Building more income. Learning about markets, analysis, how options behave, etc. “Retail trading” has more than enough material to literally be its own 4 year degree. 

Yet, the initial target for most is “beat the market. If im spending this time I should be rewarded” which is so wrong it’s not funny. You will never be compensated for your time as a trader. You are compensated for your skill and ability to trade. This is the quintessential “work smarter not harder”. If you’re able to efficiently do your work, it doesn’t need to take a lot of time. However, without concession, the learning phase takes TONS of time - just as any other skill based endeavor. 

So a new options trader, before doing all these things, saying “I want to at least beat the market” is similar to a brand new basketball player saying “id like to AT LEAST outperform league averages”. It’s so absurd it’s funny. 

If i were a new options trader, i would aim for greater than zero my first two years. Thats it. Make something. The overwhelming probability is you are NOT going to turn your small account to a large one. Again, you should focus on building the skill and approach that you can leverage over time to create wealth. 

This begins with aiming low enough to reduce the risk of blowing an account pursuing ridiculous returns and allowing yourself to actually focus on learning. 

After year 1 and 2 of > 0 (which fun fact, is still WILDLY outperforming most traders) THEN you can observe your actual performance and create a roadmap to achieve your goals thats logical and relevant to you. 

I know this isn’t fun to hear but there’s a bright side. If you are able to find your way as a trader, it genuinely is an insanely cool way to make money and you absolutely can make a lot. But that stupid (but applicable) saying of don’t worry about the money applies. Focus on the process and begin with goals low enough that they’re actually achievable and don’t completely compromise you as a trader.

Am I missing something?,"I'm new to options trading and just started using a paper account on IBKR. I came across this strategy on Adam Khoo's YT where he suggests ppl with small accounts (which is what mine will be when I transfer my first funds) start with a very conservative 30-45 days bull put strategy where you:

- identify uptrends using 20/40 EMAs and support levels using SMAs as well as looking at oversold levels;

- use this strategy only on ""big"" i.e. safe companies like Coke, Meta, Microsoft etc;

- aim at a very conservative short put with a -.10 delta and a $5 spread giving you small returns but a 90% profit chance and limited losses;

- finally, monitoring your stocks to close positions if they drop near your shorted put;

- once you get comfortable with it, start doing the strat in bigger batches for greater profits.

This seems to me too good and too easy to be true, so I'm wondering if I'm missing something? Are there any downsides/risks I'm not taking into account? The only thing coming to mind is all the chaos caused by tarriffs is an additional risk, but other than that, nothing much.

I guess I'd just have to do the math of: if every 1/10 positions is a loss, how much cash do I need to have on my account to be able to cover it (if I somehow manage to not close a position before max loss occurs).

Two other factors played a major role. Our dev ruffled some feathers by his way of ranting and his language and that definitely scared away people and made people reluctant to invest. 

The other factor, as we learned over the past week, is that he sold far more Kendu than necessary to maintain the project. Sure, a dev can and should take profit, but he was simply emptying his bags. Including the war chest that was build by selling the Kendu Chads.

I’ve been following [Trump's Crypto Portfolio](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) for a while now via [ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/) and wanted to share some of my findings with the class.

After looking into **search engine traffic, keyword search volumes, unique website visits, the number of coin holders on chain** for his largest holding, and even the **total number of backlinks from credible sites with their associated traffic to his portfolio** over the past 30 days, and here’s what was discovered:

**1. Sustained Organic Growth Indicators.**

Over the past month, **search volumes** for “**Trump Crypto**”, “**Donald Trump Crypto**”, “**Trump and Crypto**” and other similar keywords has been steadily climbing. Whenever a controversial or well-known figure is linked to anything, curiosity spikes; so this is no surprise.

Another telling sign is the rise in **credible backlinks** pointing to [Trumps Official Crypto Portfolio on ARKHAM](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump), paired alongside an uptick in **unique visitors** over the last 30 days, the website data underscores the growing curiosity—again, largely driven by Trump’s name in the headlines.

**2. Trump's Largest Holding is a Meme Coin.**

Multiple [reports](https://cryptoslate.com/trump-owns-over-50-of-trog-memecoin-amid-illiquid-32m-crypto-holdings/) indicate that **Trump holds 50% of the** [$TROG](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/trog) **supply**, making it his single largest crypto stake. Regardless of personal views on the man, having such a high-profile figure involved tends to attract widespread coverage—from mainstream headlines to crypto-focused news outlets. In other words, for many people, $TROG is on the radar precisely because of Trump.

**3. Comparisons to Other Influential Tie-Ins.**

In the past, **$SHIB** gave 50% of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, generating immense buzz and debate. Similarly, $TROG’s heavy reliance on one figure (Trump) could be a double-edged sword: it draws in publicity, yet also concentrates a large portion of the supply in a single whale. If he sells, the market could experience sudden turbulence.

4. **Organic Media Coverage.**

Several major crypto news outlets are organically highlighting that **former President Trump owns 50% of the $TROG supply**, making it his single largest crypto holding.

Organic Article 1 => [Crypto.news](https://crypto.news/donald-trump-holds-22-m-in-trog-more-than-ethereum/)

Organic Article 2 => [CCN](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/donald-trump-crypto-portfolio/)

**5. Number of Coin Holders Steadily Increasing.**

On-chain metrics show a gradual increase in the number of [$TROG](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xe3cc21af229934034b320502fa55cfa1ab7b1493?utm_campaign=contract_selector&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=coingecko) holders, implying that at least some of this attention is translating into purchases.

**6. Why I’m Sharing.**

Ultimately, I’m sharing this for **open, research-based discussion**. I’m not here to promote or provide financial advice. In my eyes, the emerging data—consistent search growth, an uptick in the number of holders of his largest coin holding, more backlinks from credible sites, and high-profile coverage—makes an interesting case study in how celebrity associations affect a coin’s visibility. Whether it’s a legitimate opportunity or just another spike in the memecoin cycle is up for debate.

**TL;DR:**

* **Sustained organic growth** is evident from rising search volumes, increased website traffic, and growing backlinks tied to Trump’s crypto holdings.
* **Trump’s largest crypto stake** is the memecoin $TROG, of which he reportedly owns 50%.
* **Media coverage** comparing $TROG to other influential coins (like $SHIB’s tie to Vitalik) highlights both potential buzz and risk.
* **Coin holders** for $TROG continue to increase gradually, suggesting market interest.
* **Celebrity associations** can amplify visibility, but also bring higher volatility if a major holder sells.

Has anyone else tracked these metrics or noticed the uptick in crypto media coverage? Curious to hear your thoughts on whether the Trump angle can sustain long-term interest or if this is just a passing spike!

That’s why I’m considering BGUSD. It’s a crypto-adjacent product backed by traditional finance stuff (U.S. Treasuries, MMFs) and pays out 4% APY You get daily payouts, and it reinvests automatically. Sounds pretty TradFi, but it’s fully integrated into a crypto platform, so still accessible with USDT/USDC.

#  Exposure ≠ Infrastructure

Sure, they brought traffic. But they didn’t **power the network**. They didn’t **run bandwidth 24/7**, burn electricity, or contribute to the actual **backbone of this DePIN model**.

So why does someone who posted a few tweets or made a YouTube video walk away with *life-changing token allocations*, while users with 10 rigs get scraps?

* 10% from their referrals
* 5% from third-levels

* For people who may not even run a single node

1. **Token dumping at every epoch** — from wallets that contributed zero bandwidth
2. **Network filled with inactive accounts** just farming points
3. **Real contributors get underpaid**, demotivated, and eventually leave
4. Influencer whales dominate the ecosystem, without supporting it

#  What Grass should do:

* Cap referral rewards **per user and lifetime**
* Phase out referral earnings if nodes go inactive
* Reward **uptime, bandwidth, and compute** — not just signups
* Separate **influencer partnerships** from **network rewards**

It's issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi protocol that's explicitly inspired by a prominent political figure (which has certainly added a layer of complexity to the discussion!).

From what i studied, it was launched around March/April 2025 and has already achieved a pretty significant market cap, reportedly surpassing $2 billion. It's backed by short-term US government treasuries, US dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents, with reserves custodies by BitGo Trust Company. They've also been making moves with Chainlink CCIP integration for cross-chain capabilities and recently got listed on major exchanges like Bitget and Binance.

**Here's what I'm curious about, and I'd love to hear the community's neutral, insightful perspectives:**

* **Legitimacy and Backing:** How confident are we in the 1:1 backing claims? While they state BitGo as custodian and plan for regular audits, the transparency of current reserve breakdowns seems to be a point of discussion. How does this compare to more established stablecoins like USDT and USDC in terms of audit frequency and public accessibility of reserve information?
* **Political Association:** The clear connection to a political figure is unusual in the stablecoin space. Does this association, regardless of your personal politics, influence your perception of its stability, long-term viability, or potential for regulatory scrutiny (both positive and negative)? Is this a new paradigm for stablecoin adoption, or a potential hurdle?
* **Rapid Growth & Institutional Adoption:** USD1's rapid rise to a $2B+ market cap in a short time is impressive. This seems to be driven by significant institutional interest, including a reported $2 billion pledge from an Abu Dhabi investment fund (MGX) for a stake in Binance. Does this signal a new wave of institutional adoption for stablecoins outside the traditional players, or are there underlying factors we should be considering?
* **Competition and Differentiators:** In a market dominated by USDT and USDC, what truly differentiates USD1 for users and institutions? Is their ""institutional-ready"" focus and conservative reserve strategy enough to carve out a significant long-term niche?
* **Potential Risks/Benefits:** What are the biggest risks you see with USD1, both from a technical and market perspective? Conversely, what are its biggest potential benefits for the broader crypto ecosystem?

This isn't about promoting or condemning, but rather fostering a robust and informed discussion. The stablecoin landscape is constantly evolving, and what do you USD1 could add to it?",For those who might not be fully up to speed USD1 is a new fiat-backed stablecoin aiming for a 11 peg with the US dollar. Its issued by World Liberty Financial WLFI a DeFi protocol thats explicitly inspired by a prominent political figure which has certainly added a layer of complexity to the discussion. From what i studied it was launched around MarchApril 2025 and has already achieved a pretty significant market cap reportedly surpassing $2 billion. Its backed by short-term US government treasuries US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents with reserves custodies by BitGo Trust Company. Theyve also been making moves with Chainlink CCIP integration for cross-chain capabilities and recently got listed on major exchanges like Bitget and Binance. Heres what Im curious about and Id love to hear the communitys neutral insightful perspectives Legitimacy and Backing How confident are we in the 11 backing claims While they state BitGo as custodian and plan for regular audits the transparency of current reserve breakdowns seems to be a point of discussion. How does this compare to more established stablecoins like USDT and USDC in terms of audit frequency and public accessibility of reserve information Political Association The clear connection to a political figure is unusual in the stablecoin space. Does this association regardless of your personal politics influence your perception of its stability long-term viability or potential for regulatory scrutiny both positive and negative Is this a new paradigm for stablecoin adoption or a potential hurdle Rapid Growth Institutional Adoption USD1s rapid rise to a $2B+ market cap in a short time is impressive. This seems to be driven by significant institutional interest including a reported $2 billion pledge from an Abu Dhabi investment fund MGX for a stake in Binance. Does this signal a new wave of institutional adoption for stablecoins outside the traditional players or are there underlying factors we should be considering Competition and Differentiators In a market dominated by USDT and USDC what truly differentiates USD1 for users and institutions Is their institutional-ready focus and conservative reserve strategy enough to carve out a significant long-term niche Potential RisksBenefits What are the biggest risks you see with USD1 both from a technical and market perspective Conversely what are its biggest potential benefits for the broader crypto ecosystem This isnt about promoting or condemning but rather fostering a robust and informed discussion.

I’m a solo dev working on a side project called Swap Syndicate — a text-based Telegram RPG that’s fully integrated with real swaps on Solana (via Jupiter), and rewards you with XP, ranks, and passive crypto.

Here’s what I’ve built (and building):

🧩 Core Concept:
You start as a Recruited Swapper in a medieval-style Syndicate world.

Every time you swap tokens (yes, even $5), you gain XP, gold, and buffs

If you invite others, you get lifetime passive rewards from their swaps

It all happens inside Telegram — no wallet connection needed

⚔️ Game Features:
📜 Text-based RPG mechanics with /commands

🧙 8 character classes:
Assassin, Knight, Healer, Warlock, Tactician, Raider, Tracker, Alchemist

🧭 Tiered quests (Tier 1–5 based on level)

🎯 Daily streaks for bonus XP & item drops

🏆 Weekly leaderboards for top players & guilds

💥 PvP Arena (planned): Duel other players for gold & prestige

🛡️ Guild system: Create your own house & earn a cut from your team’s swaps

💸 Real Passive Crypto:
Every player gets a Jupiter referral link (via API)

You earn 0.028% of every swap your invite does — forever

If your referrals bring others, you also get a cut from their rewards
(Example: they earn $10 → you get $2.5 from that)

Top players will unlock multipliers, prestige tiers, and bonus loot

No token, no presale, no staking — rewards come from actual on-chain volume

🧘 Zero Risk – You’re Just Swapping
The best part?

There’s no risk involved. You’re not betting, staking, or locking anything.

You’re literally just swapping crypto like you normally would — but earning XP and long-term passive rewards while doing it.

You can even swap back into your stablecoin after every move if you want.

It’s all tracked automatically — and it costs you nothing extra.

📈 Rewards Scale With The Community
Right now we’re testing basic rewards — but as the playerbase grows, so do the prizes.

 Bigger weekly guild pools

 More XP bonuses & prestige perks

 Special rewards for top referrers & active PvP players

 Prestige levels with permanent benefits for early adopters

The more people play, the bigger the loot gets.
It’s a system designed to scale with the community — not extract from it.

 Realistic Example:
Bring in 25 active swappers
→ They each swap just $200/day
→ You earn around $1.4/day = $42/month
→ While climbing ranks, unlocking gear and buffs



🏰 Special Monthly Guild Events (Big Pool, Big Winners)
Once a month, the game hosts a Syndicate-Wide Tournament — a month-long guild war where players grind XP, complete quests, and boost their guild’s score.

 A massive prize pool is collected throughout the month (from swap activity)

 The top-ranked guild at the end takes the biggest cut

 Individual players in the winning guild earn huge crypto rewards, prestige buffs, and permanent XP multipliers

Example:

Imagine 5,000 players swapping all month — a $10,000+ prize pool forms, and the #1 guild gets 75–85% of it 💥


Winning one of these monthly events could be worth more than a full-time job for top grinders.

Would you play this kind of Telegram RPG?
Would you grind XP for passive income and guild domination?


I’m building out the beta now — drop feedback or DM me if you want early access

* Every node can host and validate agent tasks (true P2P)
* Subnets are purpose-driven and self-governed
* Governance is usage-weighted, not just token-weighted
* Supports agent-to-agent collaboration in real time

This isn't just fork some code— it's the direction of Layer-1 design.

I’m an engineer on **Xian**, an open-source Layer-1 that runs smart contracts written in **pure Python** (no transpilers or DSLs). I’m *not* here to discuss tokens, price, or fundraising — just the architecture — and would really value feedback from other protocol engineers.

**Why we tried this experiment**

* 13 M+ devs know Python but very few write Solidity/Rust.  
* We embed a deterministic Python VM inside a Go CometBFT consensus node, so contracts execute natively while consensus stays fast BFT (~2–3 s finality).  
* Gas accounting happens at the byte-code op level; 68 % of every gas fee is automatically routed back to the contract’s author (a built-in dev-share incentive).  
* Chain data is exposed via a GraphQL endpoint, so front-end devs can query state without running their own indexer.

**What I’d love feedback on**

1. Security model of running CPython byte-code in a sandbox — anyone audited something similar?  
2. Our gas-metering approach vs. metering in WASM / EVM. Potential pitfalls?  
3. Opinions on rewarding contract authors at L1 (good way to fund public goods, or long-term bloat risk?)  
4. Any blind spots you see for dev-experience-first chains.

I’ll put the full spec, repo, and testnet faucet link in the first comment to respect the “no-links-in-OP” rule here.

Looking forward to your critiques — happy to answer anything you throw at me. Thanks!

A proposal for fair, stable token growth","**The issue**: Many tokens explode in price early or at some arbitrary date only to later collapse and never reclaim their all-time high. This applies not just to memecoins or purposeless tokens, but even to legitimate projects with real innovation and flawed tokenomics.

**My proposed solution:** A design that converts chaotic momentum into stable, gradual growth using math and a touch of community coordination.

**Feasibility rationale:** Tokens like DAI prove that the power of math and community can stabilize the price of a coin and peg it to a value. We can apply the same principle power with a different design but **instead of a stabilized peg, a stabilized growth.**

I have in mind a complete technical design and the ability to implement it, primarily in solidity (for eth or an eth based chain). It is completely trustless with no centralized control and includes a semi-DAO mechanism where users can collaborate and direct the assets backing their tokens into permissioned smart contracts so they can capitalize on the assets they control but can't force use the assets of others.

**Key Features/Properties:**

* Tokens acquired directly from the protocol can have a ""forever break-even liquidity"" while the price is algorithmically designed to grow at a stable pace.
   * (For a CEX to utilize this feature they would have to integrate the smart contract interaction. People who spot trade it are exposed to financial loses).
* Token-backing assets are not trapped and can be funneled for utilization .
* Protocol users can vote/vouch.
   * Protocol fees for yield.
   * Growth parameters (within pre-limits).
   * Prevent the release of team tokens.
      * Don't like the team? Vote that they'd get nothing.
   * Funnel funds to an external contract using a minimum threshold at deadline logic.
* Verify onchain a statement they made. An immutable proof that they said what they said.
* A complete fair launch with a given grace period to join at the base price before growth logic initiates.
   * A genuinely benevolent trustless design. ""A token Coffeezilla would be proud of"".

**Reasons for me not to do it:**

* I lack marketing skills.
* I lack visual design skills (I can do a practical UI but not a conventionally beautiful/attractive design).
* UX may be complex.
* Team disincentivized. My intent for a fair financial design may discourage potential collaborators.
* Regulatory gray zone due big brother progress proroguing governments.
* Hard work and effort that requires motivation I don't currently have.
* ""Too Ethical for Degens"" In this market, many people want to gamble and see 100x returns within a few days, they don't appreciate steady appreciation and those who do lean toward Bitcoin and large blue chip coin.

**Reason why it should be done:**

* Addresses a Real Problem. Offers an innovative low risk financial opportunity that is brave enough to see beyond short term greed.
* Innovative Tokenomics
* Built-in Integrity. Potential collaboration with Tegridy Farms.
* Realistic semi-DAO features. Community-driven, but without the overly complex systems that open the door to protocol-killing exploits.
* A fair, trustless, ethical undertaking.
* Could be fun
* Could be profitable
* Within my capabilities if I find the right support

This question has been bugging me for a while and actually motivated me to start building an open source alternative to current blockchain tech.

Yeah I know there's like a million projects claiming to do the same thing, but I wanted to share what I think crypto actually needs to be. Would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or ideas on this.

So my project (I'm calling it Volt) basically introduces what I'd call a post-blockchain architecture for moving digital value around. The big difference? It doesn't need those massive globally replicated ledgers while still keeping the security guarantees.

Each node only stores one 32-byte global state root of a Sparse Merkle Tree. Account data and proofs get fetched on-demand from a DHT network and cached locally. Transactions carry the Merkle proofs for sender and recipient, so every peer can verify and update the root super fast. No miners = no fees = instant transfers that are private and scalable.  
  
Not gonna lie, there are some tradeoffs that feel strange at first. The weirdest thing for me was not having tx history or a block explorer. It's kinda like being lost in the matrix lol. But maybe that's actually good for privacy? What do you guys think?  
  
Do you care about having a public ledger, or is the privacy worth it?

The code's on GitHub if anyone wants to check it out or contribute. I'm just one dev so any help is appreciated.

Just transacting between friends is also hard due to the lack of privacy in blockchains. You mostly don’t want anyone to know how much crypto you hold. The idea is simple, have someone keeps history of your transactions, everything remain encrypted, just that guy have your data in unencrypted form. If govt asks, they comply, but not for general public. This makes it able to provide privacy, while not being treated as a mixer.

I would appreciate any thoughts/ideas here, as I'm still not sure if it would actually work in practice. Thanks!

**Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW)**

A theoretical consensus mechanism for energy-efficient, time-regulated mining.

**How it Works:**

1. A new block is added to the chain.
2. All miners start computing a VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) with the latest block's hash as the input.
3. The VDF is designed to take 4 minutes to complete, enforcing a mandatory idle period.
4. The \~1 minute mining period begins when miners complete the VDF.
5. Miners compete to find a valid PoW for a new block, which includes the VDF output in the header.
6. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the new block to the network.
7. The block is verified by nodes by checking the VDF's output is correct for the previous block hash, and that the PoW is valid.

This cycle of a 4 minute idle period and a brief mining period continues.

**Key Advantages**:

* The idle-mine cycle allows the network to operate with \~1/5 of the hash power of a standard PoW blockchain while still taking advantage of the security properties of PoW.
* During the 4 minute idle period, the blockchain is guaranteed to be static. The predictable delay means blocks are propagated and confirmed in a more synchronized fashion, which could reduce synchronization issues and orphaned blocks.

**Potential Issues:**

* VDFs can be computed slightly faster on hardware with higher clock speeds or specialized circuits, resulting in some miners having a longer mining period.
* The short mining-window means that miners on faster connections will have a significant advantage over slower connections, as they will be able to propagate a mined block faster.
* The VDF also uses energy, although negligible compared to the amount that algorithms use.
* Miners might redirect their hash power to other cryptocurrencies during the delay period, which would undermine the goal of reducing energy consumption.
* A malicious miner who obtains or predicts the next block could start precomputing the VDF early, gaining an unfair advantage.",Ive been brainstorming ways to reduce the power usage of PoW and this is what I came up with.

A new Vitalik blog post published yesterday lays out an exploratory long-term and “radical” plan to scale the execution layer of the Ethereum L1. It’s a seemingly stark acknowledgement of all the past year’s complaints. 

The upgrade, if done, may bring efficiency gains of over 100x to the L1, Vitalik says.

How would it actually be done?

Vitalik’s proposal looks to replace the beloved Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with a general purpose RISC-V virtual machine — all while maintaining the backward-compatibility of old EVM contracts.

# What is a RISC-V virtual machine?

“RISC-V” is a hardware instruction set architecture (ISA). The simplest way to think of it is as a standardized language that defines communication between the hardware and software.

Though RISC-V was not originally built for blockchain purposes, its open design allowed crypto developers to leverage it for building virtual machines that could generate zero-knowledge proofs at far lower resource costs than the EVM.

The outcome is what’s known as a zero knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), which enables developers to write applications in high level languages like Rust without needing to be trained in cryptography.

In the absence of zkVMs, companies that want to leverage zk tech to build a privacy-secure application to process payroll/healthcare data would need to spend much more time writing custom zk circuits that cannot be easily changed after deployment (unlike a zkVM where devs could simply recompile RISC-V code).

In a recent post, I outlined a non-contract-based approach to transaction privacy on Solana using multi-hop wallets, decoy paths, and base58 export of final keys. The reception was great, and I appreciated the thoughtful feedback.

Today, I want to go deeper — not into privacy itself, but into how we secure the privacy system from abuse, probing, and behavioral inference.

This writeup discusses how infrastructure-level hardening can complement wallet-layer obfuscation, particularly for projects that are live or public-facing. Again, no links — just ideas, and I’d love technical critique.

⸻

Threat Models: What We’re Guarding Against

When building a transaction obfuscator, you’re not just defending users — you’re also defending the system from:
	•	Probing by bots trying to infer timing, fees, or decoy structure
	•	Service abuse by automation testing wallet creation and draining infrastructure
	•	IP-level monitoring that could deanonymize client locations or usage patterns
	•	Session correlation via timing or wallet output heuristics

⸻

Infrastructure-Level Defenses

Here’s how we’re currently hardening the architecture:
	•	IP Banning + Rate-Limiting
We apply auto-bans for obvious abuse (e.g., rapid repeated cleanings, malformed JSON). All sessions are ephemeral — no accounts, no cookies stored server-side.
	•	Jittered Delays Per Hop
We introduce variance between hops (via asyncio.sleep()), not just in duration but in sequence. This makes the session-to-session pattern statistically noisy.
	•	Decoy Wallet Seeding
Fake wallets run in parallel with real ones. They’re seeded with randomized amounts and deliberately simulate confirmation timings to confuse heuristics.
	•	Session Isolation
Each session has its own memory context. No intermediate wallets are stored post-transfer. Exported private keys are constructed client-side, never logged.

⸻

User-Side Privacy Guarantees

From a user perspective, we implement:
	•	Final key delivery only once, after the session completes — not during processing
	•	No re-use of any intermediate wallet, ever
	•	Base58 output compatible with Phantom and other tools, but without exposing the creation path

⸻

Design Tradeoffs We Considered

We deliberately avoided smart contracts or layer-2 approaches (like ZK) for these reasons:
	•	L1-native tools are more transparent and easier to audit
	•	No external dependencies or bridge risk
	•	Better resistance to policy flags from centralized services (compared to mixers)

⸻

Open Questions (Again)
	1.	Has anyone modeled IP-based timing analysis on Solana wallet creation APIs?
	2.	Could variable fees or decoy fee patterns leak information?
	3.	Is there value in public proof-of-burn for temporary wallets?
	4.	Any known fingerprinting methods we should be aware of?

⸻

Thanks again for the feedback last time. This is still a work in progress, and we’re trying to strike the right balance between pragmatic privacy and real-world usability.

— Happy to take critique, suggestions, or comparisons to similar L1-native approaches. Let’s build safer rails.

Title: Obfuscating Transaction Flow on Solana: A Practical Exploration of Wallet-Level Privacy Mechanisms

Solana offers one of the fastest and most cost-effective environments for decentralized applications, but its default transparency can be a drawback for users requiring privacy. In this post, I want to share a technical breakdown of a wallet-layer obfuscation strategy I’ve been researching and implementing over the past few months — strictly for discussion.

The strategy below is implemented in a working open-source tool I maintain (SolanaBlender.com, not linked to respect subreddit rules), but this post focuses purely on the architecture and implementation—not the product.

⸻

Problem Definition

Solana’s account model, like Ethereum, makes all activity public and trivially traceable. For use cases involving freelance payments, treasury management, or arbitrage bots, deterministic transfer paths can leak sensitive information — including strategy, counterparties, or earnings.

There’s a gap between smart contract encryption (e.g., Secret Network) and raw transaction activity. This post focuses on the latter.

⸻

Architecture Overview: Wallet-Hop-Based Obfuscation

This model introduces:
	•	Intermediate wallets generated for each session
	•	Randomized delays between transfers
	•	Decoy branches (fake paths that send and reabsorb SOL)
	•	Burning of intermediate wallets (deleting private keys)
	•	Client-facing base58 export of final keys (Phantom-compatible)

No smart contract is used. This leverages only the base system: create_account, transfer, and confirm_transaction.

⸻

Technical Stack
	•	Backend: Python (FastAPI), solana-py + solders for speed
	•	Confirmation Model: Polling + fallback retry on BlockhashNotFound
	•	Delay Enforcement: asyncio.sleep() randomized per hop
	•	Decoy Seeding: Multiple parallel fake routes with randomized seed values
	•	Final Export: secret_key + public_key concatenated and Base58-encoded for wallet recovery

from solders.keypair import Keypair
from base58 import b58encode

final_key = b58encode(wallet.secret() + bytes(wallet.pubkey()))

Security Considerations
	•	Sybil detection resistance: intermediate wallets are unique, unreused, and unrecoverable post-burn
	•	Decoy detection: mitigated by indistinguishable path logic and variable timing
	•	Key loss prevention: export offered only at session completion with client-side memory storage (no server logging)

⸻

Why Not zk or Mixers?
	•	ZK currently lacks scalable L1 integration on Solana
	•	Mixers (like Tornado) introduce regulatory red flags
	•	This system keeps users sovereign, transparent about final control, and doesn’t require any custom contract deployment or centralized pool

⸻

Open Questions for the Community
	1.	How do you balance UX vs. privacy in wallet design?
	2.	Are there known heuristics in Solana that can still cluster such paths?
	3.	Would integrating proof-of-burn improve this model’s credibility?
	4.	Any prior art in non-contract-based transaction unlinkability on Solana?

Would love technical feedback or peer critique on the structure and potential improvements.

In this article, they examine several critical aspects:

* **Decentralization and Resilience:** P2P networks effectively eliminate single points of failure, guaranteeing continuous operation even in the face of attacks or outages.
* **Enhanced Security and Trust:** Consensus mechanisms play a pivotal role in validating transactions without depending on central authorities, thereby enhancing security and trust.
* **Financial Inclusion and Global Access:** Individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure are empowered through the ability to conduct direct transactions.
* **Lower Transaction Costs:** By removing intermediaries, transaction fees are significantly reduced, particularly benefiting cross-border transactions.
* **Privacy and Autonomy:** Users can transact directly without the need to disclose personal information to third parties, ensuring privacy and autonomy.
* **Scalability and Efficiency**: The distribution of transaction processing across multiple nodes contributes to the scalability of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

So, my project is using zero-knowledge proofs and I am finding out that people who are not familiar with the concept (and even those who think they are) are struggling to understand it. I came up with a story below to help non-technical and technical people understand how this would work on a blockchain.

So, here goes:

John has $1,000 and needs to send $100 to Bill. Nobody can know the amounts that are being sent or how much money John or Bill has. 

Let's break this down.

1. John owns $1,000.

Instead of waving cash around, he seals the money inside a thick, light-proof envelope. Before he seals it, he presses a special wax stamp that embeds a cryptographic code tied to ""$1,000 + some random noise."" That stamp is tamper-evident: anyone can scan it later and be certain nothing inside has been swapped, yet the scan reveals zero about the real amount.

The stamp fixes the value without exposing it.

2. Splitting the funds - still in the dark.

John now prepares two new opaque envelopes:

\- Envelope A (for Bill)  
\- Envelope B (change back to John)

He secretly puts $100 in A and $900 in B, adds fresh random noise to each, and presses a new wax stamp on both. Again, the stamps hide the figures but lock them in place.

3. The referee's balance test.

A neutral blockchain referee (software, not a person) receives only the three stamp codes, never the cash. With some clever math the referee checks two rules:

\- Conservation: ""Stamp(original) = Stamp(A) + Stamp(B)""  
\- Range proof: each new envelope holds a non-negative amount (no hidden debt).

Because the math is homomorphic (computations can be performed without decryption), the referee can confirm both rules without peeling open any envelope.

If the equations hold, the referee signs a one-line certificate: ""John's transfer verified - no amounts disclosed.""

That certificate (the zero-knowledge proof) is what gets written to the next block.

4. What the world sees.

\- Everyone can audit the certificate and know the transaction is sound.  
\- Nobody learns that Envelope A contains $100, or even that Bill is receiving $100 instead of $5,000 or $42.  
\- The original and change amounts stay private, yet the ledger's arithmetic stays perfect.

There’s a lot of infrastructure for sending tokens, but **the actual user experience** still seems rough:

* Wallet addresses shared manually
* Unclear chain support
* Payment amount conversions done off-platform
* No trust mechanism for completion

* What’s your current setup? (Wallets, steps, tools?)
* Do you use fixed tokens like USDC, or just go with what the client has?
* Have you had issues with chains, confirmations, or wrong tokens?
* What’s the one pain you wish someone solved?

Traditionally, music royalties have been concentrated in the hands of major investors and industry gatekeepers, leaving little room for independent participation.

A recently developed model utilizes NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Polygon network to represent fractional ownership of a song’s royalty rights. Each NFT grants its holder a proportional share of the royalties generated by the song. This is enabled through smart contracts that automate revenue distribution transparently and efficiently.

This approach brings forward several technical insights worth discussing:

* **Scalability via Polygon:** The Polygon network was chosen for its low fees and fast transaction throughput, which are crucial for managing the microtransactions that come with music royalties.
* **Smart contract automation:** Revenue distribution is fully automated through smart contracts, ensuring each NFT holder receives their share without needing intermediaries.
* **Transparency and traceability:** All royalty-related transactions are logged on a public blockchain, increasing visibility and trust among participants.

This model not only democratizes access to music investment but also provides a clear example of how blockchain can solve centralization issues across various sectors.

The project is currently under development. Upcoming stages include smart contract security audits and stress-testing to ensure long-term reliability and integrity.

We invite the community to share thoughts on potential technical challenges and explore how this model could be extended to other use cases or industries.",Blockchain technology has opened up new possibilities in the music industry particularly in decentralizing ownership and the distribution of royalties.

Additionally, I am not citing the name of my project, or trying to promote it in any way, just looking for advice from fellow developers.



That said, a little context. The distributed capability of blockchain tech is what originally drew me to the crypto space 10 or so years ago. I have always loved the concept of essentially using greed as a key motivator to create a secure and trustless asset. I find it inspiring, as fundamentally, no ecosystem can exist free of avarice, and historically, the accumulation of malefactors is what inevitably degrades the integrity of the system. Although far from perfect, the opportunities created by this technology seems to offer the closest function for turning the greed of potential bad actors into a positive force, by rewarding meritorious action such as mining, staking, and auditing, to such a degree that it disincentivizes defectors.



Looking at what other issues that blockchain could potentially create merit based cooperation for universal good in, one of the biggest economic complaints that seems to constantly plague the world, regardless of nation, political affiliation, ect... is the poor management of inflation, leading to ever increasing escalation and instability of financial assets. Cryptocurrencies have already made inroads into this issue, such as with Bitcoin having a finite supply, and thus a deflationary trajectory, or in the case of dozens of cryptos that have regulated, transparent inflation rates.

  
It occurred to me though that although many cryptocurrencies have decentralized consensus that controls one or more aspects of the tokens inflation / deflation, I cannot think of one that has put full control of both mechanisms into the hands of the token holders. There are clear reasons for this, and in many cases I can fully understand why the developers would not want to risk bad actors having any part of their tokens minting and burning rates, nor is it appropriate most of the time. 



Still, the idea is intriguing, for, if given the opportunity, would a community of token holders be capable of self regulating the use of inflationary and deflationary mechanisms, ultimately working together to build the ecosystems financial value and stability, or, would short term greed and ""pump and dump"" malefactors overwhelm the system and cause a total loss of stability?

  
Personally I find the concept to be fascinating, so out of curiosity, a little over a year ago, I started building a token model to test this socioeconomic theory, as well as my own programming ability. Since then I have gone through several revisions, with my first few concept designs falling apart almost immediately do to architecture flaws, exorbitant on-chain fees, extreme transaction latency, and issues incorporating off-chain entities. However, about a year later and I have created what I am confident is a functional and working prototype to test my thesis, building my model using the EIP-2535 standard, with independent facets for the inflationary and deflationary modules that can be activated and deactivated via a staked voting mechanism by token holders, and with certain mechanisms, once activated, relying on off-chain entities via a ZK Rollup to handle computations to cut gas fees, with off-chain ""nodes"" handling the off-chain computations, and incentivized through the ability to host and profit from staked tokens to their nodes. Bad actors can be penalized for trying to use a node to send corrupted information by quarantining of the effected node, and both node operators and token holders are incentivized to partake in voting by the direct impact on the total supply of the token. In order to ensure that the token is not pushed to a unsustainable supply in either direction, the supply is ""rubber-banded"", ensuring that the further the supply gets from the initial supply, the more difficult activating and maintaining the supporting mechanisms will become.



 It was particularly challenging, as prior to this project I have never worked with either the EIP-2535 standard or ZK Rollups, and I stumbled more then I would like to admit.

  
All of this is to say, I am looking for input, criticism, and questions that can help me hunt down any remaining flaws that I may have been to close to the project to see, prior to its launch. Shortly after I first started this project, I posted an inquiry here about potential mechanisms to integrate into the token, and some of the responses I got were quite inspired.

On the surface, this seems reasonable—cryptographic best practices often advocate for key separation. But a closer look at how eth_decrypt functioned reveals cracks in this reasoning, suggesting the decision might mask a deeper motive.

Here’s how it worked: eth_decrypt and eth_getEncryptionPublicKey relied on asymmetric encryption. A third party could use eth_getEncryptionPublicKey to fetch a user’s public encryption key, derived from their Ethereum private key (ECDSA on secp256k1). They could then encrypt data—potentially vast amounts—using this key, e.g. via ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme). The wallet owner would decrypt it with eth_decrypt, using the same private key that signs transactions (e.g., via eth_signTypedData_v4). MetaMask argued that this dual use could expose the private key, risking account security

But this doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. In asymmetric encryption, the public key is meant to be shared—encrypting millions of messages with it doesn’t inherently compromise the private key, provided the scheme (like ECIES) is secure with proper nonce usage and authentication. Decryption with the private key is distinct from signing; it doesn’t generate a public output like a signature does, so the ""same key"" risk feels overstated. True vulnerabilities—like padding oracle attacks or side-channel leaks—would stem from implementation flaws, not the concept itself. Yet MetaMask’s 2023 blog post admitted no known exploits existed. If the risk was theoretical, why axe a feature that enabled private on-chain communication

The ""same key"" argument fits symmetric encryption better, where one key handles both encryption and decryption, amplifying misuse risks. But eth_decrypt was asymmetric, making the justification seem misapplied. MetaMask pledged support for a new encryption standard, like EIP-5630 (proposed in 2022 for safer key derivation via eth_performECDH), but as of April 2025, it’s still unfinished, leaving developers in the lurch.

They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)

However, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.

**TL;DR**:

* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.
* **PoW DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives, but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, but weak against liveness attacks.
* **PoW GHOSTDAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks, and moderately-strong against liveness attacks.
* **PoS DAG**: Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness.

-------------------------------

**Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer**

Bitcoin's longest-chain/heaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards.

Even as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes (CPU -> GPU -> ASIC -> faster ASIC), the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase.

There is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security (miners) do not have the same goals as those receiving the security (holders).

**Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful?**

The main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block, but everyone's efforts get thrown out while only the winner's block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.

**What is a DAG, and why is it more efficient and more secure?**

A DAG is another category of Distributed Ledger Technologies (blockchains are also DLTs), that has a mesh-like structure instead of a linear chain of blocks (e.g. blockchain). All valid blocks are accepted, and none are thrown away unless they're invalid or have bad signatures. Thus nothing gets wasted. Blocks are connected to each other like a mesh and ordered based on time-equivalents. Nano and the original IOTA (it later upgraded to PoS) are both PoW DAGs, and they're both extremely efficient.

Computations are not wasted, and there doesn't need to be a constant difficulty adjustment. Blocks are constantly being produced at low cost (sub-pennies) and high throughput (thousands of TPS).

In addition, longest-chain protocol is weak to 51% attacks, especially when block production is slow and there is a pool of transactions waiting to be added (a mempool). When block production is fast and the pool is usually empty, reorg and censorship attacks from 51% attacks become largely irrelevant. Sure, blocks can be reorged or censored, but the throughput is so high that transactions get added anyways by other miners seconds after the attack. So the attack only affects other miner's block rewards, which are mostly insignificant anyways. This nearly nullifies the effectiveness of 51% attacks.

Technically, there is no mining for adding transactions. The mining is mainly for spam-prevention, which is an issue I will cover later.

**What is the GHOSTDAG consensus protocol?**

GHOSTDAG is a portmanteau of GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed SubTree, Ethereum's original PoW protocol) and DAG.

Longest-chain protocol throws away blocks that are not in the longest-chain. Those discarded blocks are called uncle or orphaned blocks. GHOST uses uncle and orphaned blocks as part of the weight calculations for determining the heaviest-chain, which makes it more secure and efficient than vanilla longest-chain.

GHOSTDAG goes a step further than GHOST. There are 2 versions of this. One version includes orphaned blocks into the chain in a pseudo-DAG-like manner. The other option discards the blocks, but includes the transactions from those discarded blocks as long as they're valid. Either way, computations are not being wasted. They have the same benefits as a DAG.

Unlike with Nano's version of a DAG, GHOSTDAG (Kaspa's previous consensus protocol) has actual mining, which is mainly used for both spam-prevention and for security.

**What's the downside with DAGs?**

There's always a tradeoff. For DAGs with high throughput, it's spam.

Longest-chain's ultimate goal is to maximize energy-spending (and e-waste production) until the block reward is expended. DAG's goal is to maximize block production until transaction demand is fully-met.

DAGs are so fast and efficient at producing blocks that they can become extremely spammy and sometimes have issues with liveness.

Nano had this problem because it went to the extreme of having no fees. Everyone was a miner, and everyone was constantly producing blocks. This leads to storage bloat and increased node/RPC hardware requirements. Mining was practically costless, but full nodes were not being compensated for storing the full ledger, and ledgers can grow very quickly when throughput is high.

Thus DAGs need some kind of process to reduce spam. Nano adds a small Proof of Work mechanism to combat spam, but they probably didn't go far enough. Nodes/RPCs are still not being compensated, and they're partially responsible for security. GHOSTDAG improves on this by requiring miners and a transaction fee paid to miners. This lessens the burden for security on uncompensated nodes and shifts it to the miners.

So it's possible to produce a partially secure, safe, and efficient PoW by using DAGs or GHOSTDAGs. There is still some minor/miner misalignment of economic incentive because under PoW, those providing security do not have the same economic incentives as those receiving security.

**PoS DAGs**

Going one step further ...

A PoS DAG protocol is even more secure. On top of all the benefits of DAGs, now validators are economically-compensated for providing security, and they have economic incentive to provide security, so the interest of those providing security and those receiving security are aligned.",Similar to how the proverbial paperclip-maximizer will eventually reconstruct all planetary matter into paperclips Nakamoto Consensuslongest-chain is a highly-inefficient family of Proof of Work PoW consensus protocols that maximize energy-usage. They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward i.e. when marginal profit 0 However not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks. TLDR PoW Longest-chain Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discardedwasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks. PoW DAG Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has moderate economic security incentives but weak spam-protection. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks but weak against liveness attacks. PoW GHOSTDAG Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts nearly all valid transactions. Has moderately-strong economic security incentives. Strong against safety-type 51% attacks and moderately-strong against liveness attacks. PoS DAG Makes blocks cheap to produce. Accepts all valid blocks without discarding. Has strong economic security for both safety and liveness. ------------------------------- Longest-chain is an Energy-spending maximizer Bitcoins longest-chainheaviest-weight is a family of consensus protocols that maximizes energy-spending and e-waste production until the marginal profit reaches zero. It will stop only when the cost of production exceeds the security budget from its block rewards. Even as mining rigs become more efficient at producing SHA256 hashes CPU - GPU - ASIC - faster ASIC the never-ending difficulty adjustments completely nullify that efficiency increase. There is major miner misalignment of economic incentive under longest-chain because those providing security miners do not have the same goals as those receiving the security holders. Is it possible to design a PoW protocol that is less wasteful The main problem with longest-chain is that it wastes computations. Everyone is trying to build a block but everyones efforts get thrown out while only the winners block is accepted. One way to decrease wastefulness is to not discard effort. There is a way to use discarded blocks under which is to use other consensus protocols like DAGs and GHOSTDAG.

Power is the productive use of energy over time

Using power at scale is what gives us allthe beautiful things-television, freezers, computers, the internet, washing machines, air conditioners-you name it.

Economic growth isn't possible without using more energy. It's energy that drives growth by taking raw materials from nature, processing them, and creating useful things that people buy.
Wealth is perfectly correlated with energy usage
That's why you won't find a single rich country that consumes little energy

The foundation of wealth is using energy to run machines so humans can focus on creative work, thinking. or simply enjoying life
Wealth is about freeing your time from basic needs.

America currently uses around 4,000 terawatt-hours of power per year, while China uses more than 10,000 terawatt-hours.

That's why China has become the world's factory and the top trading partner for over 120 countries. The world can't function smoothly without Chinese goods

China is more productive because it uses more energy than any other country. And the most productive country is the one most capable of repaying its debt.

So if the U.S. truly wants to preserve its
creditworthiness and global financial dominance for another century, it must reach 30,000-40,000
terawatt-hours of energy use per year.

When America can deploy that much energy. robots will build and drive cars. Human muscle will be fully replaced by robotic arms. Al embedded in robots will teach, treat patients, and more
The cost of goods and services will fall sharply. With higher productivity and lower prices. people willearn more from creative work and be able to save
The economy will run on surplus, enabling the U.S government to repay its mountain of debt.

But there's a serious PROBLEM:
America can't deploy that much power in industry and the workplace without triggering high inflation at first.
And high inflation severely punishes bondholders.

So. people will dump U.S.Debt, which will cause an economic depression.
Now, why does deploying power and building
automation cause initial inflation?

Because to do all that, America must import robots from China, extract cheap gas and oll from Alaska, and build hundreds of nuclear plants using domestic labor.

All this would be funded by credit creation-since the U.S.has no savings. Fresh credit creation leads to sustained inflation.

Here's just 1 EXAMPLE:
To build iPhones in the U.S. Apple would have to invest Tens of billions of dollars and wait 3 years just to manufacture 10% of them domestically.
Unless an iPhone costs over $7,000, it's not coming
back to America for production. That's inflation.

Here is my question 
Can the U.S. expand energy use to 30,000+ TWh without collapsing the dollar or triggering runaway inflation?",$38 trillion in Debt doesnt matter for America if it can produce enough Power.

Following up on my earlier post where I asked for ideas, I wanted to share an exciting opportunity for those who want to make money in the markets but don’t have the time or desire to do all the analysis themselves.

**Here’s a quick overview:**  
I’ve developed a high-probability, rule-based trading system that generates signals on a 30-minute timeframe. From those signals, we select a basket of 3–5 stocks and divide capital equally among them. The system focuses on maximizing the probability of success with strong risk management and consistent performance.

**What’s great about this?**

* You don’t need to analyze charts or understand the underlying strategy.
* I won’t be sharing my custom indicator or the specifics of the system, but I will guide you step-by-step on how to trade the calls I provide.
* The system has been back-tested and shows promising consistency.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I want to connect with people who are serious about making money in the markets but lack the time or expertise for detailed analysis. If you’re open to following my trade calls and guidance, I’ll provide you with clear entry, exit, and risk management instructions.

**Here’s what I’m offering:**

* Trade calls with full guidance on execution.
* A 1-week free trial so you can see how it works without any commitment.
* In exchange, I’d appreciate your help with back-testing, feedback, and testing any future strategy variants.

If this sounds interesting, comment below or DM me. I’ll share more details about how the process works and answer any questions.",Hey everyone Following up on my earlier post where I asked for ideas I wanted to share an exciting opportunity for those who want to make money in the markets but dont have the time or desire to do all the analysis themselves.

\- Microsoft: (only because setting a new datacenter takes years and it's easier to just rent for now from coreweaver)

\- NVIDIA: (Company that holds 5% of Coreweaver) Is renting the GPUs they sold to coreweaver. And I wonder for how long will NVIDIA sell GPUs to rent them back...

2025-05-28T11:24:52.594666,2025-05-28T11:19:07,Bitcoin,1kxcm7k,I made a hardware device to store seed phrases physically — no need to punch steel,"**Hey everyone** 

I’ve been thinking about how to securely back up a crypto seed without having to engrave it into steel or rely on other irreversible methods.

So I came up with my own solution — and built a working prototype.

# 💡 How it works:

1. Plug the device into your computer via USB and click **“Generate Seed”**.
2. The device lights up specific holes using red LEDs — those are where you need to insert screws.
3. Just insert the screws into the lit-up holes.
4. Each screw represents a binary bit, which together form BIP39 seed words.
5. On-screen, you’ll see a progress bar for each of the 12 words — showing how many screws are still missing.

✅ **No technical knowledge required**

✅ **Mistake-proof** — if you insert a screw in the wrong place, the software warns you

✅ **Seed never leaves the device** — it’s securely stored in an Optiga chip, just like in a Trezor

# 🔁 Benefits:

• **Reusable** — want to change the seed? Just remove the screws and start over

• **Secure** — the seed is never exposed to your computer or software

• **Error-proof** — you can’t get it wrong; the device guides you

• **Quick to “destroy”** — moving a few screws is enough to make the seed unreadable

• **Fire/water-resistant** — even if the electronics are destroyed, the screw positions remain and the seed can be reconstructed

(The case is made of bead-blasted stainless steel)

• **Shamir backup ready** — 5 extra holes at the bottom right are used to label which share this device represents (e.g. 3 of 5)

# ⚠️ Downsides (for now):

• **Tiny screws** — working with 2mm screws isn’t the most convenient

• **Contact reliability** — this is still a prototype; sometimes screws need to be re-tightened to ensure contact

Ideally, this could one day work directly with a hardware wallet. It's just a small side project I've been working on. I would love to know what you are thinking about. Does it even make sense?

Also taking into account the context about huge news like:

>-The fucking President of USA will buy 2 Billion in Bitcoin as treasury asset for his company.

>-Multiple other corporations an nation around the world announcing they are buying Bitcoin. 

>-Accelerated adoption not only as store of value, but as a medium of exchange with the huge news like Stake & Shake adopted Bitcoin worldwide (in every country where they have stores), and announcing yesterday murder adoption because it is working great and they are saving money along with they costumers (-50% cost per transaction).

>-Pro-Biticoin regulations implemented,  pro-Bitcoin federal officials in all key agencies and cabinet positions, pro-Bitcoin bills advancing fast in congress. 

>-Black Rock (his ETF clients) buys over 400 million USD yesterday for 4th consecutive trading day.

>-Bitcoin on exchanges multi year low, suggesting a supply shock coming. 

>-US Treasury (Besent) and the Fed (Powell) using language that they will print as much money as needed to support the economy (they mean to prevent a fiat collapse).

>-Global liquidity skyrocketing,  which Bitcoin always follows a few months later.

>-US credit downgraded, dollar index dropping.

>-10 and 30 yield rates rising and nobody wanting to buy US bonds anymore, and even some countries starting to dump them.

>-USD global reserve status collapsing.

>-Nasdaq rocketing lately, yesterday alone over 460 points (around +2.50%).

>-Gold holds close to ATH.

>-JPM fucking Demon announces they will let their customers buy Bitcoin.

>-Fidelity,  Bank of America  and other huge financial institutions puting out super bullish Bitcoin growth forecasts.

I’m planning to launch a token, but I’m a bit stuck on choosing the right blockchain. There are so many options and I’m not sure what really matters for my specific project. My token will be a mix of utility, governance, and security features. It will give holders access to specific services, allow them to vote on important decisions, and represent ownership or stakes in the project.

I plan on using smart contracts with medium complexity to manage things like token distribution, voting mechanisms, and other conditional processes. Scalability is important, but I’m not sure how much that should weigh in the decision.

What other factors should I consider, like transaction fees or ease of development? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

All of these things are hurting adoption. 
So far this year over 1.6 billion in crypto has been hacked. Already more than last year.

A front run requires a transfer.
Phishing requires a transfer. 
Bots require transfers. 

So a simple solution is limiting the size of transfers or establishing a certain amount of time in between transfers. Example if you buy something on a decentralized exchange it requires an exchange from the router to your wallet. So you could set a timer that  prevents any additional transfers until a certain time has passed. This would prevent any transfers and therefore prevent any phishing or slhacks during that time. Bybit for example could not have been hacked with this simple fix. 

I've seen projects experiment with this with great success. One such project is called HUNDRED which has a 100 hour time lock between transfers. I'd like to get your thoughts on this new potential fix. It would solve a lot of problems in the crypto space. ",There are problems within the crypto industry that no one seems to be dealing with.

Like all Proof of Work (PoW) networks, Bitcoin is mostly secure from 51% attack (majority attacks) as long as its security budget remains high relative to the total value protected. There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.

As of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: ""Miners Revenue"" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).

There is a well-studied, recent research paper covering this long-term systemic risk to Bitcoin:

**""The Imminent (and Avoidable) Security Risk of Bitcoin Halving""** - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4801113
	
This research paper from Apr 2024 analyzes the long-term effects of Bitcoin halvings on Bitcoin's security budget and Bitcoin's security.

Due to the halvings, Bitcoin's security relative to the amount being protected (aka the ""security budget ratio"") roughly halves every 4 years. Transactions fees have not been rising enough to make up for the loss in block subsidy. In fact, transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the total block subsidy. The Cost of Attack (CoA) on Bitcoin is expected to continue declining in the long run.

####**The researchers identify many major long-term issues for Bitcoin's security model**:

* **Misaligned security incentives**: Bitcoin miners are profit-driven. Unlike with PoS, Bitcoin miners do not have strong economic incentive to protect Bitcoin when mining is no longer profitable. There is economic loss in protecting Bitcoin against a strong 51% attacker.
* **Declining security budget ratio**: The ""widening divergence between the decreasing security budget and the rising total value of Bitcoin has been identified as a substantial long-term security problem"".
* **Price instabilities**: ""can push mining activity far below its equilibrium value"" where ""the hash rate required by a 51% attacker is substantially reduced""
* **Secondary markets from unprofitable mining**: ""In our default scenario, the 28% of miners that become unprofitable in post-halving equilibrium may be willing to sell their hardware. Then an attacker who aims to acquire 50% of the total hash rate could buy this cheap hardware.""
* **Cost of Attack**: Was previously expected to be $5-20B in mining equipment, but possibly much cheaper due to secondary markets. Ongoing cost is $100M/day cost for maintaining a 51% attack.
* **Timing attacks**: Due to difficulty adjustments around halvings, the total hash rates can be up to three times lower than before the halving, making Bitcoin 3x easier to 51% attack.
* **Insufficient Transaction Fees**: Transaction fees on average have not risen at all, and are too low to cover for the loss in block subsidy from halvings
* **Goldfinger attacks**: ""Stakeholders with intentions to undermine Bitcoin or profit from short positions may actively engage in Goldfinger attacks""

Note that the researchers based their figures on S9 ASIC miners since those are readily available on secondary markets. The CoA using newer S19 and S21 miners should be even cheaper by up to 3x because they are much more efficient.

####**Possible solutions**

The authors recommend several solutions, all of which require controversial hard forks.

* Removing supply cap and having permanent block subsidy issuance
* Imposing minimum mandatory transaction fees
* Switching to other more secure consensus protocols (like PoS)
* Using a gradual inflation-reduction curve to eliminate sudden shocks in mining drops from halvings
* Implementing a smaller max difficulty-adjustment

Their primary recommendation is to remove the supply cap and allow for permanent sustainable block subsidy issuance. It is questionable whether the Bitcoin community will accept many of these proposals.",The elephant in the room Bitcoins declining security budget Like all Proof of Work PoW networks Bitcoin is mostly secure from 51% attack majority attacks as long as its security budget remains high relative to the total value protected.

ARKB and GBTC posted outflows. The move reinforces the idea that institutions keep accumulating BTC while price hovers near $109 k.

Why it matters

Institutional signal – Big inflows, especially into IBIT, hint at strategic accumulation rather than short-term trading.

Vehicle rotation – Outflows from ARKB and GBTC suggest investors are switching to lower-fee or higher-liquidity ETFs.

Quick macro backdrop

Monetary policy – Fed minutes drop today (28-May); the market still expects the first rate cut in September–October.

Correlation watch – May has delivered $5.77 B of net inflows to BTC ETFs, their best month since November, while the S&P 500 has treaded water.

That’s the thing you lot are investing in - this is not an opinion but a fact. Give it a thought, why does Ripple do this? Why does it think it needs to do this? Is this the place you want to put your money on?

Free world, free choice.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. It’s on display at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas at the moment.

So this was what they removed, which says a lot about the people involved.

Honestly, how are people still buying the XRP dream in 2025? Ripple has been dumping on retail for years and somehow folks still act like it’s the next big thing. The Ripple foundation (or whatever they call themselves now) keeps unlocking billions of XRP from escrow and selling it straight into the market. Like clockwork. Retail gets excited about some vague announcement, and boom — here comes the dump. Every. Single. Time.

And can we talk about use case for a second? Who is actually using RippleNet? Like, seriously. Go ahead, I’ll wait. There’s no real volume. No big adoption. Just partnerships that sound impressive on paper and end up being “pilots” that go nowhere. It’s all smoke. And mirrors. And more smoke.

Meanwhile, the banks Ripple was supposed to “disrupt” have made it clear they want stablecoins. Not XRP. Not volatile tokens that dump 30% on a Tuesday because the market hiccupped. They want compliance-friendly, fiat-pegged coins they can actually use without scaring off regulators. USDC, USDT, maybe a CBDC or two — not your grandma’s XRP bag.

And yes, let’s not forget the lawsuits and the regulatory “clarity” that’s always juuuust around the corner. Same story since like 2018. At this point it’s just hopium. XRP isn’t a revolution, it’s a nostalgia project. Like MySpace for blockchain. Except MySpace had actual users.

The community’s down bad but still talking like it’s 2017 moon season. Wake up. Ripple isn’t taking over the banking world — it’s taking your liquidity and thanking you for the exit liquidity.

Anyways, thanks for the statue. Thanks for reading my rant and hope to see you on team bitcoin, to make an actual positive impact for our world and not just for the banks.

Will a real downturn only start once everyone’s convinced it can only go up? 
And then we’ll be the ones left holding the bag?
Or maybe we’re just wrong, and the market’s going up because the economy is actually stronger than we think — and tariffs or potential inflation will be absorbed by healthy, structural earnings growth?

They have launched the first system approved for non-invasive spinal cord stimulation for people with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The ARCEX System is indicated to improve hand sensation and strength for people with a chronic cervical spinal cord injury.\*

(ABM FN) Kepler Cheuvreux has raised the price target for Onward Medical from €10.00 to €13.00, while maintaining a Buy rating.

Onward is undergoing a transformation process, as the first commercial sales are now taking place in the U.S. and progress is being made in Europe. This requires the necessary infrastructure to be put in place, according to Kepler. Much will depend on hospitals’ willingness to adopt Onward’s technology. It is also important to what extent Onward succeeds in securing reimbursement for its treatments.

2025-05-28T14:48:39.129656,2025-05-28T12:37:57,Daytrading,1kxdsuk,Reading the markets through TA - an approach that works,"As the title suggests, I see this way too often in traders struggling with TA even after years of experience learning the markets. The best kind of approach to reading price is to study price in the most classical way - as in without the use of indicators or fancy tools to assess what price is going to do. Or reading too much into candlestick size or shape. 

In technical analysis - what matters most is price behaviour, why does price behave the way it did and what caused it? There are buyers and sellers - why are they buying here or selling here? Volume. Where is volume and how can you spot it? Key levels. If key levels are important - how can I spot that? Through price rejections (wicks). And if I spot those key levels - how can I trade? Reading momentum, market structure and overall bias of whether it’s a choppy market, ranging market or bullish / bearish market. Now, if I read that - can my trade be a winner? The answer is yes and no. Yes, if you read price correctly based on key levels and other price action factors and accurate about it - you have 70-80% chance of your trade working out - leaving 10-20% chance of it not working out. 

Why? 

Because even though price action factors and key levels (volume areas) affect price behaviour - price has the tendency to always reverse using any other key level or price action factors that can go in the opposite direction of your trade. 

For example- if I’m looking into buying SPX at a certain key level - the price action factors suggest that yes it’s a bullish momentum, yes it’s a major key level price is sitting at, yes NY market is open (volatility) and yes the overall market structure is bullish - but, the other factors for a reversal could be - but price has been going up for a while now, the volume that’s needed for buy has to be a lot more now, price could very reject the zone above and reverse due to low buyers and so on. 

Now, if you compare the trades - for a buy or a sell, and a buy looks more probable due to “market conditions” then it a definitely a good buy trade but if it’s the other way around? Wait to sell at a better price than a key level that was meant for a buy trade. 

I don’t know how many people actually get it - but just thought I’d share. I’m not going to argue saying that THIS IS THE ONLY WAY it can work - all I’m saying this is a way that actually works. 

Thanks. 

",As the title suggests I see this way too often in traders struggling with TA even after years of experience learning the markets. The best kind of approach to reading price is to study price in the most classical way - as in without the use of indicators or fancy tools to assess what price is going to do. Or reading too much into candlestick size or shape. In technical analysis - what matters most is price behaviour why does price behave the way it did and what caused it There are buyers and sellers - why are they buying here or selling here Volume. Where is volume and how can you spot it Key levels. If key levels are important - how can I spot that Through price rejections wicks. And if I spot those key levels - how can I trade Reading momentum market structure and overall bias of whether its a choppy market ranging market or bullish bearish market. Now if I read that - can my trade be a winner The answer is yes and no. Yes if you read price correctly based on key levels and other price action factors and accurate about it - you have 70-80% chance of your trade working out - leaving 10-20% chance of it not working out. Why Because even though price action factors and key levels volume areas affect price behaviour - price has the tendency to always reverse using any other key level or price action factors that can go in the opposite direction of your trade. For example- if Im looking into buying SPX at a certain key level - the price action factors suggest that yes its a bullish momentum yes its a major key level price is sitting at yes NY market is open volatility and yes the overall market structure is bullish - but the other factors for a reversal could be - but price has been going up for a while now the volume thats needed for buy has to be a lot more now price could very reject the zone above and reverse due to low buyers and so on. Now if you compare the trades - for a buy or a sell and a buy looks more probable due to market conditions then it a definitely a good buy trade but if its the other way around Wait to sell at a better price than a key level that was meant for a buy trade. I dont know how many people actually get it - but just thought Id share. Im not going to argue saying that THIS IS THE ONLY WAY it can work - all Im saying this is a way that actually works.

2025-05-28T14:48:39.129656,2025-05-28T12:39:56,CryptoMarkets,1kxdtwv,"How I Built a Step-by-Step Plan to Turn $1,000 into $25K–$100K (And What Most Traders Get Wrong)","Over the last few months, I’ve seen many retail traders sidelined — either due to poor timing, overtrading, or simply holding the wrong assets during the wrong phase of the market. Many are down to $1,000 or less in capital, feeling like they’ve already lost the chance to benefit from the market momentum.

But the truth is, if you still have $1,000, you’re not out — not yet. I’m going to share a simplified framework that I’ve personally found useful. It’s designed for those starting with small capital, and it avoids hype, overconfidence, or unrealistic expectations. This is not financial advice, but it is a strategic perspective.


Step 1: Big Coins Move Slow. You Need Microcaps.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are great, but doubling your $1,000 in BTC might take months or years. That doesn’t work if you’re trying to build quickly in a fast-moving bull market. The focus should shift to microcaps — tokens with market caps under $1 million — that still have actual teams, products, and traction.

These aren’t listed on Coinbase or Binance. You’ll need tools like MetaMask (a free crypto wallet) and networks like Fantom or Polygon, where transaction fees are low and small-cap gems still exist. You can use aggregators like CoinGecko or DexScreener to explore these projects.


Step 2: Find Two Solid Projects

Split your capital — $450 into one project, $450 into another. Get involved in their communities (Telegram, Discord), ask about the team, the roadmap, the product. You want to avoid rugs, so verify there’s some real development and activity.

Criteria:
	•	Project has a working product or MVP
	•	Team is still active during the bear market
	•	Telegram isn’t a ghost town
	•	Liquidity and market cap are verifiable


Step 3: Take Profits Early

If your microcap investments go 3x, sell 50% immediately. Now you’ve turned $900 into $2,700 and derisked. This strategy is about compounding gains, not holding forever.


Step 4: Repeat With Larger Plays

Reinvest that $1,350 into two more well-vetted projects. You’re now holding four positions. In a realistic scenario:
	•	One does 10x
	•	One does 3x
	•	One breaks even
	•	One fails

That gives you around $6,000 portfolio value.


Step 5: Upgrade Trade Sizes

With larger capital, you move to higher market cap coins. Use $2,000 positions and look for momentum — projects being actively discussed, traded, and trending. These aren’t unknown anymore, but they still offer 2–3x opportunities.

Exit quickly and consistently. If you make $10K from $1K, don’t let it all ride. Cash out $1,000. Make it real.


Step 6: Systemize Wins, Don’t Chase Home Runs

From this point, the goal isn’t to 10x again. The goal is to make $5K repeatedly. Stack small wins. Protect profits. Keep repeating the strategy: identify trends early, rotate profits, and gradually reduce exposure to high-risk assets.


Step 7: Cash Out and Scale Down Risk

Once you realize $20K in profit, move most of it off-exchange. Don’t re-risk it. Trade with a smaller stack ($5K–$10K) if you want, but understand: the goal was reached.

If your remaining capital goes to zero, you’ve still succeeded.


Final Thought

This isn’t a story of “get rich quick.” It’s about using strategy, risk management, and discipline to build something from almost nothing. The key is understanding how to operate at every stage of the journey — not just how to win trades, but how to survive, scale, and eventually walk away.

If it doesn’t work? It’s not a failure. Sometimes the best move is to take a break, focus on your career or business, and wait for better conditions. Crypto will still be here.

After selling puts and getting assigned 500 shares of VST stock in February I’ve managed to bring down my cost basis to start making a plus from a strike @ $155 above.
I’m currently selling covered calls and I’ve sold 5 contracts with a $155 strike price expiring on December 19th. Currently, the stock price is at $164.

I’m wondering how I should adapt my strategy. Do you think I should:
1. I should just accept the possible early assignment? 
2. Buy back the call option and sell another one or multiple at a higher strike price?
3. Something else entirely?

2025-05-28T14:48:39.129656,2025-05-28T13:16:11,CryptoTechnology,1kxefse,Why I built JournalTrade.io (and why you probably need this too),"Six months ago, I was staring at my trading history asking the question we all ask: **""Where am I going wrong?""**

The answer hurt. It wasn't the markets. It wasn't lack of technical knowledge. It was me. My emotions. My lack of discipline. My inability to face my own mistakes.

Every experienced trader says the same thing: *""Keep a trading journal!""* But when I got home, exhausted after a frustrating session... opening Excel was the last thing I wanted to do. Especially when I knew I'd have to write about the trades that went wrong.

**Nobody likes confronting their own mistakes.** It's human nature. But it's also what separates us from consistently profitable traders.

I realized I needed something that made this process less painful. Something that would help me see patterns without judging me. That would show me the truth clearly, but constructively.

So I built **JournalTrade.io**.

It's not just another tracking tool. It's an honest mirror that helps you grow as a trader. Works for crypto, stocks, forex, and futures - because we all face the same internal demons, regardless of the market.

**Here's the truth:** if you can't face your losses, you'll never maximize your wins. If you don't understand your emotional patterns, you'll repeat the same mistakes indefinitely.

I launched it today, still very early, but it's already helping me become more disciplined. And if it's working for me, I know it can work for you too.

Look, I've been there. Knowing you should journal, starting strong for a week, then... nothing. The cycle repeats. The same emotional traps. The same ""I'll start tomorrow"" mentality.

I won't lie to you - this won't make you profitable overnight. But it will make you a more aware trader. And that awareness? That's the difference between those who quit and those who grow.

Perfect entries. Perfect exits. Perfect confluence. They believe that if they can get in right at the wick and get out at the top, they’ll finally become consistent. But here’s what usually happens: they miss the entry by a few ticks and watch the move leave without them. Or they get in early, stop out, then re-enter worse.



The obsession with being precise turns into overthinking, hesitation, revenge trading, or skipping the trade altogether. I got caught in trying to be perfect, especially when you see ICT, CRT, etc. traders supposedly getting in and out by the tick.  I'd mark up zones down to the exact tick, adjust levels during the session, and pass on setups because the entry wasn't ""perfect."" It took me months of journaling to realize I wasn’t actually improving, was just getting more rigid.



The turning point came when I stopped aiming to be perfect and started aiming to be repeatable.



Now I only focus on:



**Do we have a clear draw of liquidity?**

  
**What red folder news is taking place?**

  
**Are we bullish or bearish? (at least for the short term)**



**Did I follow my system?**



**Was the setup one I’d journaled and reviewed before?**



**Did I manage risk correctly and size appropriately?**



**Did I exit based on plan, not emotion?**



**And most importantly: what does my data say?**



This is where journaling became critical.  I started tracking my actual trade quality not just PnL with Tradezella. I noticed my best days weren’t the ones with surgical precision. They were the ones where I followed the same process, regardless of outcome and I also left runners and didn't get nervous and just close all my positions at once. Having a runner system to me is critical. I spent a lof of time back testing and then went live again. I use Tradingview to chart and I also trade on Tradovate to actually place my trades.



The more I looked at the data, the more I saw how chasing precision was costing me money. I was passing on great trades just because they weren’t textbook clean.



You don’t need to be perfect. You need to be systematic. You need to review your behavior.

And you need a way to track that,whether it's in a notebook or with a proper journaling tool. If your trading still feels chaotic, like you’re starting from scratch every morning, this might be why.

Also I really recommend having a morning routine ( I know this won't make you profitable blah blah blah) but, having a routine like going for a walk, meditation/breathwork, stretching or whatever it is that calms your mind can give you a way better advantage. Don't just get out of bed and start clicking buttons.

Hi, im not sure how to start here but i need help with optimizing a trading strategy thati have been working on for months. i really think this strategy can work to be really profitable but just in the extra push or eyes or figuring out how.

I learned this strategy through another group that had a very high win rate, however their strategy depends on how advance you were with a-lot of different confluences.

I wanted to simplify it a bit and from my results i was able to 2x my account multiple times in a few days, but the downside is one lost can set you back pretty badly. The RR isn't great but due to the higher win rate it makes up for it, as long as you have a good set up.

My problem is i can't narrow down to what is considered a bad set up. I have a video of the strategy if you want to dm me i can send it over, and also I have the strategy written out. Its pretty extensive but would love to have someone work together in building this to be profitable.

I really like this strategy because it gives you multiple times to get me out of the trade in profit before a lost.

You’ll know pretty quickly if your idea is trash—or worse, if it almost works, which can keep you stuck chasing tweaks that don’t solve the core issue.

Backtesting is helpful, but it only gets you so far. In fast-moving markets, latency, fills, spread widening, and even psychological hesitation can make or break a strategy that looks great on paper. A perfect model in a perfect environment is a fantasy. The real world is noisy, messy, and unforgiving.

A few hard lessons I’ve learned the rough way:

If your edge disappears when commissions or slippage are added, you never had an edge.

If you can’t explain your logic to yourself in a sentence or two, you probably don’t understand it.

If your strategy relies on being “right” more than being controlled in risk, it’ll eventually blow up.

Most of the gains in this space don’t come from predicting the future—they come from identifying tiny inefficiencies and consistently exploiting them with tight risk controls. It’s more like being a high-frequency pickpocket than a fortune teller.

Also, it helps to be obsessive about post-trade analysis. I track every trade—entry, exit, slippage, intended logic vs actual outcome. Sometimes the market does something dumb, but more often, I did something dumb and need to fix it.

If you're thinking of jumping into this kind of trading, here’s what I’d recommend:

Start with a simple, testable hypothesis. Don’t overcomplicate it.

Focus on execution quality—you’ll be shocked how much edge gets lost here.

Keep a trade journal. No excuses.

Be ready to burn a few strategies before you land on something robust.

Like I said earlier, I’ve put together a free reference doc—basically a distillation of some lessons, models, and stuff I wish I had earlier on. If you want it, just DM me. Not selling anything, just sharing.

Hello, I started futures trading about 6 months ago. I’m a student. I did a part-time job and invested my salary into trading. Everything I know, I learned myself—from YouTube.

**Initial Success**  
At first, it went really well. I learned about divergences and used them to trade in a bearish trend. I didn’t know much about anything else, and I didn’t use a stop loss (yep, that was a dumb mistake). I just laddered in if the price moved against me. It was very profitable and went well for about a month—I doubled my capital effortlessly during that time. (There were some liquidations, but I recovered losses quickly.)

**Transition to Full-Time Trading**  
I traded about three times a week (on my off and half-days). Eventually, I couldn’t manage both my job and trading. I started to lose more often since I wasn’t allowed to use my phone during my 12-hour shift and couldn’t monitor my trades. But I was still profitable, so I decided to trade full-time and began trading every day.

**Market Conditions Change**  
Then, the higher time frame (HTF) trend shifted from bearish to bullish.

**Learning Curve**  
I learned more as I started losing more money. I picked up the other basics like support and resistance, chart patterns, then SMC (Smart Money Concepts), and price action. But I ended up losing more than I earned. Eventually, I was left with only 1/3 of my original capital.

**Current Challenges**  
Now, I’ve learned a lot more about trading than I used to. But when I look at a chart now, I see both bullish and bearish confirmations—which leaves me confused and unsure of direction.

**Improved Risk Management**  
I started using a stop loss recently. Now I’m able to achieve a higher ROI percentage on most of my successful trades, and I do catch better setups. But since my capital is nearly gone, I can only invest small amounts—resulting in smaller, insignificant profits.

**The Cycle I'm Stuck In**  
Everything goes well for about a week, and then i wuld do some dumb shit and blow a whole week’s worth of profit. I’ve been stuck in this doom cycle for almost two months now.

**Request for Help**  
Does anyone have any advice for me? It would be extremely helpful.

**Reflection**  
I guess the HTF trend change, trying to trade every day, and not using a stop loss are some of the main reasons for my losses.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is leaving Washington -- to the relief of Tesla shareholders everywhere. The personal and corporate brand damage done during Musk's turn to politics was real, but it can heal if Musk takes his medicine. Will he?

The Musk political whirlwind is well-documented at this point. He backed President Trump's candidacy after the Pennsylvania assisnation attempt. Tesla stock soared after Trump's victory, hitting almost $490 in December. Investors were convinced the budding bromance between Musk and Trump would yield benefits for Tesla. Then Trump tapped Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

After that, Musk was seen more in Washington and less at his companies. DOGE's controversial actions turned off left-leaning voters, the ones most likely to buy Tesla vehicles. Tesla stock traded below $222 in April, or more than 50% from its peak, as concerns mounted.

Tesla stock has recovered some of the recent losses as Musk heads back to his day job -- and maybe this time, shares can hold on to them. ""If he stays off politics, doesn't tweet anti-people stuff, I think [brand damage] fades in a year,"" says Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber. ""But Elon is Elon, and I don't know if he learned anything from his DOGE disaster.""

There is some evidence he has. Musk famously hates public relations, but he recently sat down with CNBC's David Faber and CBS's David Pogue to get out his side of the story.

It's also important to remember that, while always controversial, Musk has his supporters, even early on in the DOGE process. ""DOGE will improve government efficiency and reduce our budget deficits,"" Leo KoGuan, Tesla's third-largest individual shareholder, told Barron's earlier this year. ""That's a good thing.""

Individual shareholders represent a significantly larger bloc than average for Tesla. Some 40% of shares available for trading are held by smaller retail investors, according to Bloomberg. The average for the rest of the Magnificent Seven is closer to 20%.

That's why it's a good idea to take the temperature of retail investors when evaluating Tesla stock. Musk's Wednesday tweet thanking President Trump for the opportunity to serve the administration was commented on 43,000 times (as of early Thursday). Many comments were positive, praising Musk's efforts.

Only ""5% brand damage is left,"" says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, adding Wednesday's tweet was another step forward. ""Still lots of wood to chop for Tesla, but they have their leader back in the pilot seat."" Ives has a Buy rating and a $500 price target on the stock.

That's optimistic. The numbers show it's hard to sell cars to only half of the political spectrum. Tesla's first-quarter sales dropped 13% year over year, the worst quarterly decline in the company's history; in April, European sales roughly halved. There is little evidence of a rebound in buyer sentiment.

Musk, for his part, doesn't appear to mind declining car sales. He's focused on AI. ""I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock,"" he said in July 2024. ""If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock....all these other questions are in the noise.""

June is huge for Tesla's stock and the brand on that front. Tesla uses AI computing to train its autonomous driving software, and the company is on the cusp of launching a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, next month. However, the launch will proceed slowly, according to Musk, with humans overseeing early rides remotely.

That has some investors nervous. ""The risk/reward of the Austin event is asymmetrical to the downside,"" says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black. A bad [launch] would crush Tesla's autonomous brand and the stock. The remote operators are there to ensure a safe outcome, ""but that's hardly scalable."" Black recently sold his Tesla stock, holding no shares for the first time since 2021, citing a valuation that has stretched out to 180 times estimated 2025 earnings.

The importance of AI and autonomy in solving both the brand and valuation problems can't be understated. Tesla has millions of cars on the road with the potential to become robotaxis once Tesla's Full Self-Driving, or FSD, software gets good enough. The earnings potential from an Airbnb-like setup with Tesla owners putting their vehicles into a Tesla-controlled ride-hailing network is hard to project -- but it is significant.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard doesn't see any brand damage leaking into the ride-hailing opportunity. ""It's going to launch in Texas,"" he says, lowering the odds of a backlash. In the long run, if a Tesla robotaxi is half the price of an Uber, ""am I really going to care about Elon's political affiliations."" Sheppard rates shares Buy and has a $355 price target for the stock.

For Tesla, being one of the companies, along with Alphabet's Waymo, successfully solving autonomous driving -- a technical feat much harder than anyone at the 2004 DARPA autonomous driving challenge imagined -- can help restore some of the lost sheen from Tesla's brand.

""The advancement in FSD-related features, including [the] robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, should help create a new era of demand, "" said Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja on his company's first-quarter earnings conference call, adding, ""We think our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner.""

Tesla also plans to launch a new lower-price model in the coming weeks. New cars, new self-driving cars, and less Musk in Washington are the prescription for recovery.

Tesla stock rose 0.4% on Thursday, closing at $358.43, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.

Those gains left Tesla shares up more than $120 since the company's April 22 first-quarter earnings report, when Musk said he would spend less time in Washington. That move is worth some $400 billion in market value, more than the value of Toyota Motor, Ford Motor, and General Motors combined.

Musk's departure from Washington was a good first step in the healing process. Investors will have to wait to see if it's cured.

Let me analyze the company Carvana from an insider’s perspective.

Carvana’s stock once plummeted from $360 to $4 during 2021–2022, but now, almost miraculously, it has surged back to $320.
As of pre-market on the 29th, Carvana is valued at $69 billion — which is about 7 times the valuation of CarMax, the largest used car dealership, and AutoNation, the largest new car dealership in the U.S. However, Carvana’s revenue is only about half of theirs, and its growth rate isn’t particularly strong. The significant growth seen in Q1 of 2025 was largely due to the seasonal impact of tax refund season.

In fact, the first company I founded was modeled after Carvana. When I stepped down as CEO, our revenue was about one-seventh of Carvana’s. The fundamental challenge in this industry is that the product (used cars) is non-standardized and customers have no loyalty to the platform. This means rapid expansion or monopoly is virtually impossible. Customers simply look for the best value car, and every unit sold requires heavy operational input. The business requires managing a large workforce across dispersed locations. Online platforms do offer advantages — mainly in helping users find rare car models more quickly — which can attract a segment of users. But your personnel costs won’t decrease, and while you might save on physical retail space, your transportation and labor costs will rise. So, going online doesn’t improve your profit margins‼️

There are no obvious economies of scale in this industry!
Carvana’s best-case scenario is to reach the scale of CarMax at its peak — adjusting for inflation, that’s under $30 billion in valuation, which corresponds to a stock price of about $140.

On top of that, Carvana has been involved in financial manipulation. The founder’s father is also the founder of DriveTime, another car dealership chain. In 2024, DriveTime is known to have purchased $800 million worth of auto loans from Carvana. In the first three quarters of 2024, Carvana’s auto loan business earned $540 million in profit — more than twice its total net profit. For details, refer to Hindenburg’s short report.
In short, the founder’s father could have used DriveTime to obtain bank loans and then purchased Carvana’s loan assets at a loss to falsify Carvana’s financial data — and eventually just default on the loan and go bankrupt. Of course, this is speculation from me and short sellers — it’s enough for you to be aware that this kind of possibility exists.

Even worse, auto sales is a shrinking business. The rise of Robotaxi services will lead to reduced car ownership, and the increasing adoption of direct-to-consumer models by EV manufacturers (like Tesla), as well as decreasing vehicle production costs, will continue to erode the market.

In the broader transportation sector, any company that goes against the logic of autonomous driving is likely to lose most of its value in 10 years.

But be careful: short selling is highly risky, and its expected value is generally negative. Even if Carvana is only worth half of its current price, it might still go up another one or two times. Without strong patience and discipline, do not short lightly.

By the way, there’s a significantly undervalued company right now — Reddit. If you’re interested, I can also share my semi-insider analysis on that.

What Happened: Considering the same level of imports from 2024, the Kobeissi Letter has calculated a rough amount of $10 billion in tariff revenue that the U.S. must have collected since April 2, so far.

This includes the 10% baseline tariff on all countries as well as the higher rates imposed on select countries.

Thus, if the Federal Court orders are upheld despite the Trump administration’s appeal, the government would have to refund an amount of around $10 billion to its trading partners.

However, any judgment via the appeal process could come by mid-to-late June 2025, predicts Craig Shapiro, a macro strategist at Bear Traps Report.

“If they are granted the stay, they get to keep collecting the tariffs during the appeal process, says Shapiro and “If not, they are kinda screwed on all subsequent negotiations with trading partners and will have that huge hole in the budget process that was meant to help pay for tax cuts.”

Additionally, in another X post, he explains that the appeal process will induce more uncertainty, which already existed because of the tariff regulations and the tax bills. This will eventually impact corporate strategy, as there would be no clarity.",The Federal Courts decision to strike down President Donald Trumps tariffs could have a widespread effect on the economy stock market and individual companies which were starting to settle with the idea of higher duties.

Gross domestic product decreased at a 0.2% annualized pace in the first quarter, the second estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday. That compared with an initially reported 0.3% decline.

The economy’s primary growth engine — consumer spending — advanced 1.2%, down from an initial estimate of 1.8% and the weakest pace in almost two years. Meantime, net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from the GDP calculation, slightly more than the first projection.

The slight upward revision in GDP reflected stronger business investment and a greater accumulation of inventories. Federal government spending wasn’t as much of a drag as originally reported.

GDP figures are revised multiple times as more data become available, enabling the government to fine-tune its estimate. The first projection, released in late April, showed the economy contracted for the first time since 2022. The final estimate is due next month.

Metric (QoQ, SAAR)	Latest	Prior est.
GDP	-0.2%	-0.3%
Consumer spending	+1.2%	+1.8%
Imports	+42.6%	+41.3%
Business investment	+10.3%	+9.8%
PCE price index, excl. food, energy	+3.4%	+3.5%
Economic growth was dragged down at the start of the year by a surge in imports as US businesses tried to get ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. More moderate consumer spending, as well as a decline in federal government spending, also weighed on the figure.

Since then, the White House has walked back or delayed some of the more punitive levies, and most of the tariffs have been blocked by a US trade court. While the pauses have helped calm Americans’ concerns about the economy and prompted many economists to scrap their recession calls, tariff rates are still substantially higher than before Trump took office. 

Forecasters largely expect GDP to rebound in the second quarter as higher duties discourage imports, and the goods already brought in will accumulate in larger inventories that add to growth. Beyond that, economists and policymakers will be paying close attention to how Trump’s policies — including trade, but also immigration and taxation — will impact consumer and business spending going forward.

Thursday’s data showed underlying demand across the economy was weaker than initially thought in the first quarter. Final sales to private domestic purchasers — a measure favored by economists that combines consumer spending and business investment — rose at a 2.5% rate, the slowest in nearly two years.

Consumer spending was revised lower largely on weaker demand for cars. Outlays for services, including health care and insurance, were also lower. 

Trump contends his trade policies will stoke economic growth over the longer term through the revival of domestic manufacturing, which he says will boost employment and lower the prices of US-made goods.",Bloomberg -- The US economy shrank at the start of the year restrained by weaker consumer spending and even bigger impact from trade than initially reported.

When I started, I spent a few months focusing on why 95% of traders aren't successful and after many fluctuations/emotional rollercoasters here's what I've actually learned from trading FOREX. Not in any particular order.

1. It's not a scam. (MLM's are a scam)
2. It's not a ""Get Rich Quick"" scheme. It's a walk, not a run.
3. There are multiple methods to the madness. A proven strategy combined with consistency and discipline of action are what matter.
4. Your strategy has to be adaptable to changing markets.
5. Some Prop Firms are LEGIT for real traders, many are scams.
6. No strategy is 100% effective. 
7. Having a SL is mandatory.
8. Mastering your own psychology really is the most important aspect.
9. Demo accounts are good for strategy testing but do very little to build robotic psychology. 
10. The market will remain unstable longer than you can remain solvent. (Saw this one on another post)

I use Market Structure on naked charts to trade with the trend (Support/Resistance, OBs/FVGs, Liquidity zones) at specific times for specific pairs. I also maintain a R:R of 1:3 minimum for sustainability. It took months of refinement, analysis, and forward testing with a live account to understand what it means to achieve success. Bottom line is, it's not easy or fast (unless someone hands you the keys to the kingdom) but it's achievable and extremely rewarding. 

For my #5 reason, I want to clarify that this is when you hit ""Conscious Competence (CC)"" and are moving into/have achieved ""Unconscious Competence (UC)"". From the various groups and communities I've been apart of, many people stay at step one (Unconscious Incompetence) or quit at step two (Conscious Incompetence).

Many people who achieve UC or CC don't bother with general trading communities, and have either isolated or moved to more exclusive ones. Once you hit a certain (emotionless trading) level I've seen and learned that it's just a lifestyle and a daily flow that doesn't need outside influence or input because you're just, ""In the Zone.""

So for all the striving traders out there that keep changing strategies and thinking it will never work, don't give up. Get your mindset under control, be patient, don't over risk, and be consistent. It truly does pay off.",Ive been trading for 3 years and have been consistently profitable over the last year.

That couldn't be further away from the truth.

If you can't follow SIMPLE rules, you shouldn't be trading. Not props, not live personal capital, NOTHING.

If you're blowing funded challenges it's definitely a YOU problem, because you can't trade. You can't manage risk, you aren't consistent and you don't understand how simple math and statistics can work in your favor.

Trading is a long term play. Not a ""get funded in 2 days and retire next month"" scheme.

Prop rules are actually very reasonable. 10% draw down, 5 daily... some don't allow news (you should be grateful for that) .. i really don't see the issue?



Sure, props are making a bunch of money from uneducated traders who think they will be rich in 4 business days, but the conditions they supply for those who are actually serious about trading are wonderful. 

If you believe props are scamming you, pull yourself together.



NOTE: My Special Funds, Unicorn Funding, Happy Meal Fund, Become Rich FX and similar fucking stupid names for props, ARE actually a scam. 

BUT again, if you fall for that shit... take responsibility for your actions and don't cry about it online.",I see plenty of posts and comments on how prop firms are a scam and are holding you back from making money.

Today, I was thinking about learning trading. If you look at reddit traders everybody keeps having the same issues in trading, like overtrading, overleveraging, bad risk management, emotional trading, bad entries and so on.

However, if you ask the traders, they know the answer to fix the majority of the issues. Example if asked about risk management they may say limit position size and so on...

But why in the world we keep making the same mistakes? There are so many resources out there to teach us, and we can fix most of the issues. 

So how can we actually learn trading the right way? What needs to be done to get better? How would you learn it right if you started over from scratch? What advice would you give to yourself if you were starting again?

Forget the noise. Forget the frantic chasing. There's a fundamental truth most miss: this market isn't a zero-sum game. It's a universe of potential, a boundless ocean of value constantly in motion.
For too long, we've been playing small, fighting for crumbs. But what if we saw it differently? What if we recognized the sheer abundance that pulses at the heart of this global exchange?

This isn't just about lines on a chart. It's about energy. Your energy. Are you trading from a place of fear, or a place of knowing the wellspring is endless?

The moment you truly feel the inherent abundance, the moment gratitude becomes your baseline – not just for wins, but for the very opportunity to participate – everything shifts. You're no longer a predator in a limited landscape. You become part of the flow.

This isn't theory. This is fundamental. The greatest breakthroughs happen when we see beyond limitations. So open your eyes. Open your mind. There is more here than you can possibly imagine. The reservoir is full. Are you ready to draw from it?

You need to understand something: prop firms are doing more harm than good. Their rules aren't built to help you succeed they're built to trap you. You're trading on demo accounts, under artificial conditions, chasing targets that have nothing to do with how real, consistent trading works.

This isn't how professionals operate.

Prop firms are designed to appeal to traders with low capital. That’s how they pull you in dangling the illusion of opportunity while keeping you stuck in a loop of gambling behavior. It's a hit of dopamine, a quick fix. But like crack, it's destroying your mindset and wrecking your long-term potential.

If you're serious about trading, stop focusing on passing challenges. Start focusing on the process. Build a real system. Backtest it. Track it. Refine it. Even if you're only trading a $1,000 account if you show consistent, verified results, you will *never* have a shortage of capital.

Money follows proof. Not hype. Not luck. Not a 30-day prop challenge.

Treat this like a business. Build a track record. Track your metrics. Get results. That’s what attracts real investors. That’s how you scale. That’s how you win.

1. ""***You will jump strategies, trading assets and take advice from people who aren't making a single dollar in trading.""***   

1.  This is the regular path of any trader, anyone that wants to learn something and doesnt know where to start its obvious that he would take a lot of advices, its the start of his journey thats where you start to understand which things make more ""sense"" to you , what do you want to learn and what you want to stay away.

  
2. ***""I speak from experience. I've been there. It made my learning curve MUCH longer. STAY AWAY FROM TRADING GROUPS.""***

2.  This is because you were not discipline , its not about the groups , its about you couldnt focus on a thing at the time because you were looking for fast money or ""fast experience"" on trading, so you would accept anything without any filter. Its all about the person not the groups, your responsability on what approach you want to take and how self-taught and conscious you are about what you are doing, that cycle of self repeating patterns like constantly swapping strategies and look for advices only can be broke by you, some tak 1 year and others take more time and im not even talking about really testing a strategy thats fits you, this is only the emotional part. For me it took more than a year.



3.  ***""And for those who wanna make the group: Why is your group better than millions of others out there? What is it that you can offer, what i can't get EVERYWHERE else?""***

3.  In my case my group could be worth it millions, I have the proof that the strategy works, well i am doing that live for free. I didnt saw anyone doing what I do on youtube. I mean by that , that the criteria and the strategy are not being teached on youtube for example.

Great, but yesterday was a terrible day scalping for me. And it's important to post about realistic crap too. After trading for 15 years, I still took a dumb trade yesterday.

So, let's see what I did about it. As usual the numbers were changed to not ""brag"" but the percents are correct and that's the only thing that matters.

Here's the P&L from my scalps yesterday. The numbers alone won't tell you the full story, so we'll get to that. But here they are in descending order with the most recent trade on top.

    3.43
    -4.31 (rollover)
    7.00
    2.07
    22.00
    25.27
    12.00

This totals up to `$67.46` in profit, which would be about 1% of my bankroll in profit. Despite being really, really silly and making a bad trade that would've otherwise cost me hundreds. Also, you may wonder why I have rollover for scalping. Let's talk about that.

The last trade I took that ended in `$3.43` was a doozy. I made a dumb choice while scalping and it cost me. So, I had to transform that scalp into a swing trade and hold it overnight to get out of it. You can do that you say? Of course, there's no rule in trading saying you cannot be creative. Had I closed the scalp out on the same day I would've been down hundreds.

I knew I'd hit negative rollover turning it into a swing and getting out at almost break even. And yet, that's much better than losing enough to wipe out a week's worth of profits over one bad scalp.

Why is this important? You will always lose trades. Accept it. You will always make silly mistakes. Accept it. I've been trading 15 years and do silly crap still. That will never stop.

All you can do is watch/learn how price works and focus on loss mitigation so your screw ups don't wipe you out. That last trade wasn't a win. It was a silly mistake and me saving my butt so I don't wipe out a week's worth of profits.

And yet, you can still walk away with a 1% gain after making a silly mistake.

Loss mitigation my friends. Protect your downside.

Wishing y'all the best.",The other day I posted about how its ok to lose a trade while getting 1.8% return in 2 hours. Great but yesterday was a terrible day scalping for me. And its important to post about realistic crap too. After trading for 15 years I still took a dumb trade yesterday. So lets see what I did about it. As usual the numbers were changed to not brag but the percents are correct and thats the only thing that matters. Heres the PL from my scalps yesterday. The numbers alone wont tell you the full story so well get to that. But here they are in descending order with the most recent trade on top. 3.43 -4.31 rollover 7.00 2.07 22.00 25.27 12.00 This totals up to $67.46 in profit which would be about 1% of my bankroll in profit. Despite being really really silly and making a bad trade that wouldve otherwise cost me hundreds. Also you may wonder why I have rollover for scalping. Lets talk about that. The last trade I took that ended in $3.43 was a doozy. I made a dumb choice while scalping and it cost me. So I had to transform that scalp into a swing trade and hold it overnight to get out of it. You can do that you say Of course theres no rule in trading saying you cannot be creative. Had I closed the scalp out on the same day I wouldve been down hundreds. I knew Id hit negative rollover turning it into a swing and getting out at almost break even. And yet thats much better than losing enough to wipe out a weeks worth of profits over one bad scalp. Why is this important You will always lose trades. Accept it. You will always make silly mistakes. Accept it. Ive been trading 15 years and do silly crap still. That will never stop. All you can do is watchlearn how price works and focus on loss mitigation so your screw ups dont wipe you out. That last trade wasnt a win. It was a silly mistake and me saving my butt so I dont wipe out a weeks worth of profits. And yet you can still walk away with a 1% gain after making a silly mistake. Loss mitigation my friends. Protect your downside.

I currently have a 3.2% interest rate locked into my mortgage.  I only owe about $50k so I’ve essentially got that money sitting in a short term treasury since I just can’t bring myself to pay it off.  

Now seeing how the 30 year treasury bond works, interest rates are inverse to price.  So I just asked one of the mortgage loan officers at my bank, would you all take an early pay off for less than the principal considering my interest rate is so low?

To me this seems like a no brainer for the bank.  I pay them $48k instead of $50k, they take that money and buy a 30 yr bond now earning 5% instead of 3.2% and essentially take all the risk away of me defaulting or something.  Seems like a win win for the bank and a simplification of my situation to pay off the loan.  I didn’t do the actual math, I’m just giving an example I know makes sense for both parties. 

I’m guessing the bank has already “factored” in the loan, but this is a super easy arbitrage play that has no risk to the bank.

I'm 29 years old and trying to build a balanced ETF portfolio focused on maximizing returns while keeping volatility manageable. After some research, I’ve come up with a mix including:

* **FXAIX (Fidelity 500 Index Fund)** — 35%
* **VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)** — 15%
* **QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust)** — 30%
* **VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF)** — 20%

My reasoning:

* FXAIX + VOO give me solid, low-cost exposure to the U.S. large-cap market.
* QQQ adds tech-heavy growth potential.
* VT diversifies globally to reduce risk.

Is this a reasonable allocation for someone my age looking for growth but wanting to avoid huge swings?  
  
Are there better alternatives or tweaks I should consider? Also, does holding both FXAIX and VOO make sense, or is it redundant?

For those who don’t know, ThumzUp is a Los Angeles-based company focused on social media marketing. They’ve built a platform that pays regular people  to post about brands on social media, kind of like turning everyday users into micro-influencers. They’ve got a mobile app and a dashboard for advertisers to customize campaigns, and they’re expanding fast—recently hit over 600 active advertisers in 2024 and are aiming for 1,000 by mid-2025.What caught my eye is their aggressive move into Bitcoin. They started by buying $1M worth of BTC in January 2025, then doubled down to $2M (19.106 BTC) by the end of the month. Their board even approved holding up to 90% of their liquid assets in Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy, which is a bold play for a small-cap company with a market cap around $34M. They’re also planning to raise up to $500M through a shelf registration to scale their platform and buy more Bitcoin, which sounds like they’re all-in on crypto.They’re not just hoarding BTC—they’re integrating it into their business by paying gig workers in Bitcoin and exploring more crypto use cases. Their CEO, Robert Steele, has been vocal about seeing Bitcoin as a “store of value” and a hedge against inflation, especially with growing institutional interest (like Bitcoin ETFs and even talks of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve).On one hand, this could be a smart way to diversify their treasury and align with the crypto trend, especially since Bitcoin’s been climbing. They’re positioning themselves as a forward-thinking tech company, blending social media, AI, and blockchain. On the other hand, putting 90% of their cash in Bitcoin seems super risky for a micro-cap like this—volatility could hit their balance sheet hard, and they’re not exactly MicroStrategy with billions to cushion the blow.So, what’s the deal? Is ThumzUp’s Bitcoin strategy a genius move to ride the crypto wave, or are they overextending themselves? Anyone else looking at TZUP or similar small-cap companies jumping into crypto?

So from what I know, the default is FIFO and wash sale is when u sell a stock at a loss and your losses are determined by your trade lots, not the average price of all lots. Ex; i buy 100 shares of XYZ @$10 then i buy another 100 shares at $7, so my average for the 200 shares is $8.50 but i decide to trim half and sell 100 shares at $9, the 100 shares i sold would be the first lot that I purchased which is $10 right? And so if i wanted to buy some more shares in the next 30 days it would trigger a wash sale right? But if I were to switch my account to LIFO, using the same scenario, would I be able to avoid the wash sale risk? Ex; i buy 100 shares of XYZ @ $10, then buy another 100 at $7 then i sell 100 shares at $9, (the 100 shares I am selling should be the ones I bought at $7 right?) so technically if i wanted to buy more XYZ sometime within the next few days, it would not be flagged as wash sale right? So LIFO is better for short term traders who average down? Not sure if i got this right

I also consider that REITs can be a wise choice, since the non-tax-preferential treatment of their distributions is irrelevant in a Roth.

* **Gold:** Seems like a safe store of value, especially with inflation and global instability. But from what I’ve read, it doesn’t grow that much in a short time. Would it just preserve my money instead of growing it?
* **Small business:** I’m also thinking about using the money to start something small, maybe online (reselling, dropshipping, tutoring, etc.). I’m willing to put in effort and learn, but I’ve never run a business before, so I’d be going in with no real experience.

The judges ruled that the president overstepped his authority because the Constitution reserves regulation of foreign commerce to Congress. The White House has already filed a notice of appeal, but it has 10 days to lift the affected tariffs in the meantime. Sector-specific levies on steel, aluminum and automobiles (Section 232) and the China-only duties (Section 301) remain in place.

What did the CIT decide, exactly?

It declared unconstitutional both the “universal” tariffs (10 %–25 %) and the extra duties on Mexico, Canada and China announced on 2 April, because IEEPA doesn’t grant “limitless” tariff powers.

It issued a permanent injunction ordering the administration to publish new orders rescinding those tariffs within ten days.

Which tariffs are still in force?

25 % on steel and 10 %–25 % on aluminum under Section 232.

25 %–100 % on Chinese goods stemming from Section 301 investigations.

Any other sector-specific duties justified on “national-security” grounds were outside the scope of the ruling.

Market reaction

Doesnt Etoro insure accounts up to a million?

Yes, eToro does offer an additional layer of protection through a **free insurance policy covering up to £1 million** per eligible client. However, there are important details and limitations to consider:

# 🛡️ eToro’s £1 Million Insurance — Key Facts

* **Coverage Scope**: This insurance is provided by Lloyd’s of London and covers **cash, CFD positions, and securities** in the event of eToro’s insolvency or misconduct. ([CompareBrokers.co](https://comparebrokers.co/etoro-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Eligibility**: The insurance is available to clients of **eToro (UK) Ltd.**, **eToro (Europe) Ltd.**, **eToro AUS Capital Ltd.**, **eToro (ME) Ltd.**, and **eToro (Seychelles) Ltd.**. ([eToro](https://www.etoro.com/about/why-choose-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Exclusions**: **Cryptocurrency holdings** (non-CFD) are **not covered** by this insurance. ([QualeBroker.com](https://www.qualebroker.com/uk/reviews/brokers/etoro?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Automatic Enrollment**: Eligible clients are automatically covered; no additional registration is required.

# ⚠️ Important Limitations

* **Aggregate Cap**: The total payout under this insurance policy is capped at **€25 million** (or equivalent in other currencies). This means that if multiple clients file claims simultaneously, the compensation may be distributed proportionally, potentially resulting in payouts less than £1 million per client.
* **Excess Amount**: The insurance is subject to an **excess amount** (similar to a deductible), the specifics of which are defined in the applicable policy. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/q162fs?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Not a Substitute for Regulatory Protection**: This insurance complements but does not replace the **Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)** in the UK, which covers up to **£85,000** per person per firm.

# ✅ Conclusion

While eToro's £1 million insurance policy provides an additional safety net beyond standard regulatory protections, it's essential to understand its limitations, especially the aggregate cap and exclusions. If you're considering investing amounts exceeding these protections, diversifying across multiple regulated platforms can help mitigate risk.([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/rihlue?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

I have an USD account with etoro, I'm based in the EU so every time I deposit money to the Etoro account it gets converted to USD. 

So let's assume that I deposited 100 EUR on Jan/05/2022 at an exchange rate of 1.1 (1 EUR = 1.1 USD) so the amount deposited to my etoro account is 110 USD.

  
Let's say that after 2 years my portfolios values goes to 124 USD and I decide to withdraw my total balance. The exchange rate when I withdraw is 1 (1 EUR = 1 USD). So I get a total of 124 EUR.

My total capital gains stems from two reasons:  
1. The profit I made from the trade (124-110) USD = 14 USD \* 1 (deposit day exchange rate) = 14 EUR  
2. The profit because of forex rate where the value of the Euro went down = 10 EUR.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

What makes it even more confusing is that once you calculate that the Yen has fallen by 2.9% against the dollar over the same period, the ADR has returned more than double what the underlying stock did in a currency adjusted return which seems completely backwards for the forex moment.

Simply put, the courts have said that certain tariff decisions are irrational, the White House has argued that they are its own “exclusive authority”, and the two sides have disagreed, and now it's going to the Supreme Court.

Now I'm going to make some points:

I think the market volatility is coming, in the current global supply chain has not fully recovered, the dollar is strong, inflation is still in the “borderline” moment, if the Supreme Court suddenly reversed the tariffs decision-making power, it may detonate is:

A sudden surge in some industry stocks (e.g., U.S.-based manufacturing)

It could also hit importers, e-commerce stocks (like Amazon, Walmart's supply chain) and tech stocks? They could be “accidental casualties” of the global supply chain dependency.

And it's happening at a very sensitive time, not forgetting that the Fed hasn't decided whether or not to cut interest rates.

Political rivalries are heating up in an election year.

Trade sentiment between the U.S. and China also remains tense.

Q2 earnings season is just around the corner, and any policy changes could be “amplified”.

I think there's a potential impact:

The volatility index, the VIX, could pop a little bit.

Treasury yields could be sentiment-driven.

Sector rotation may become more frequent and more active in the short term

Here's what I'm thinking:

Could this be an attempt by the White House to increase its “active” control of the economy? In other words, it may be testing the maximum boundaries of “executive power” in the realm of economic policy. And if the Supreme Court sides with the White House, it could set a precedent for “unilateral trade policy maneuvering.”

Now that would be problematic:

If the Supreme Court sides with the White House, would you take a position in U.S. industrial stocks (e.g., steel, machinery, energy) or would you be bearish on global tech stocks?

Do you think this could be a political move by the Biden administration to “win over the local manufacturing vote”?

A second federal court has ruled against President Donald Trump’s emergency tariffs on imports from around the world, dealing another blow to his trade agenda and efforts to strike new deals with dozens of countries.

“The International Economic Emergency Powers Act does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs set forth” in four executive orders Trump issued earlier this year, D.C. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras said in a decision ordering a preliminary injunction on the collection of the duties on the two plaintiffs who brought the case.


Justice Department attorneys had urged Contreras not to approve the companies’ request for an injunction, saying it would act like a “magnet” in attracting thousands of other companies to challenge the duty.
Contreras, who also called the tariffs “unlawful,” stayed his order for 14 days “so the parties may seek review in the Court of Appeals.”",Link - A second federal court has ruled against President Donald Trumps emergency tariffs on imports from around the world dealing another blow to his trade agenda and efforts to strike new deals with dozens of countries.

Are you positioned for this?","I've been thinking about how much attention AI and green energy get when we talk about future economic shifts, but like space, specifically low-earth orbit, is quietly creeping up as a major factor.

Between Starlink rapidly expanding their global internet coverage, private launches skyrocketing, and countries like India and China going ham on orbital infrastructure, I'm starting to feel like LEO is going to be economically critical sooner than we might expect.

In the last week alone, China launched satellites that are part of a space-based supercomputing network designed to handle AI workloads in orbit. That kind of development could fundamentally change how we think about data processing, global connectivity and infrastructure. If compute power and control systems start moving off-planet, we may be looking at a future where whole chunks of commerce, logistics, and supply chains are tied to orbital assets instead of terrestrial infrastructure.

Here are the tickers I'm watching in the space space:

$JEDI - A low volume but relatively stable ETF, for broad exposure to satellite tech, communications and LEO development.

$IRDM (Iridium Communications) - Already have a fully operational satellite constellation, with redundancies, in LEO. Well positioned to benefit from increases in space defense spending and emergency communications.

$LMT (Lockheed Martin) - Everyone's favourite defense contractor, they have strong space exposure, including manufacturing and launch partnerships. Purchased a modular spacecraft construction company, Terran Orbit, last year, further increasing their space exposure.

$BA (Boeing) - Beyond commercial aviation, Boeing is a giant in the satellite and ISS-adjacent fields, with commercial aviation as a solid backstop.

$AJRD (Aerojet Rocketdyne) - Smaller cap than some others on my watchlist, but a key supplier of propulsion systems used in a range of launch and orbital projects.

$NOC (Northrop Grumman) - Massive player in the satellite and launch vehicle space, heavily involved in US government space initiatives.

Curious to see what others think, do you agree with my picks, or are there stocks better positioned to benefit from the upcoming shift to orbital infrastructure?

  
EDIT: Silentbob2306 has pointed out that AJRD is now owned by LHX, which is a slightly less pure play as it's now bundled with a few other sectors, but the AJRD propulsion tech is still there and I believe will only become more profitable as demand for the tech increases.

Now I’m kicking myself for not buying more when it was $130-$132. **Nonetheless, I plan to add more, paying $10 extra for a stock I expect to reach over $250 in the next three years, is OK. And I can always add more on declines.**

The small $ 1 Bn beat for Q1 results was impressive considering the $ 2.5 Bn in lost H-20 sales to China, but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 Bn for Q2, **in spite of $8 Bn in H-20 lost sales in Q2.** One can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at $ 53 Bn instead of $ 45 Bn!

**Trying to thread the needle and trade Nvidia is missing the woods for the trees.** 

**Inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for Nvidia over the next several years, as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization. Similarly, seen is Agentic AI demand, which is a revenue-bearing product of reasoning and inference, and will continue to grow.**

This was Jensen Huang on the conference call today on inference demand.

>“Well, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time.”

**One-year product cadence:** Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up, and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its [annual GTC conference](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidias-big-show-hits-its-marks-but-plays-to-tough-crowd-35462acb?mod=article_inline) in March, including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks. 

[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q1-earnings-report-2025-62ff6a10?mod=hp_lead_pos4), analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year.

And Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26, successfully transitioning from the Hopper series

**I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short, and with all the sovereign and other AI demand, it might even be exceeded, even without Chinese sales, with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi, easily making up for the lost sales.**

Accelerated computing is the new paradigm, and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing. 

From Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call. 

>“So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. And so, computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars; it's compute, storage, and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that.""



Cloud computing was just the start; these will follow. 

**On-Premise Computing and PCS** – Nvidia has already announced new products –  RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station, which are going to replace “traditional” CPU-run PCs, are designed for developers who want to work on-prem.

**Enterprise AI** is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters.

**Physical and Industrial AI** – through the Omniverse and robotics: 

Jensen Huang on the earnings call:

> “And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important.""



Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.”

**NeoClouds** – Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds, like Coreweave and Nebius, should be a huge business. 

Lost in all this was Gaming revenue, which grew 42% to $3.76 billion, 33% above analysts’ forecasts! $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate – that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwell’s product strengths. Auto was another gainer, jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.

**I believe we’re in just the 2nd innings of a 9 innings AI revolution, and my 3-year target for Nvidia is $250, and I’ll continue to add on declines.**",I had mentioned yesterday that I wasnt going to hedge Nvidias Q1 earnings ignore the noise and stay invested for the long term.

Well we would like to serve all of it and I think were on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today the ideal computer thinking machine if you will for reasoning AI. Theres a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount the number of tokens reasoning goes through is 100 times 1000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. Its essentially thinking to itself breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools reading PDFs reading web pages watching videos and then producing a result an answer. The longer it thinks the better the answer the smarter the answer is. And so what we would like to do and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so this is going to be a huge huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. One-year product cadence Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its annual GTC conference in March including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks. According to the Wall Street Journal analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year. And Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26 successfully transitioning from the Hopper series I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short and with all the sovereign and other AI demand it might even be exceeded even without Chinese sales with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi easily making up for the lost sales. Accelerated computing is the new paradigm and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing. From Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call. So thats the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course in order to do that we had to reinvent literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built and -- but now were in full production. Its going to be exciting. Its going to be incredibly exciting. And so computing is one stack one part of it. But remember enterprise IT is really three pillars its compute storage and networking. And weve now put all three of them together finally and were going to market with that. Cloud computing was just the start these will follow. On-Premise Computing and PCS Nvidia has already announced new products RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station which are going to replace traditional CPU-run PCs are designed for developers who want to work on-prem. Enterprise AI is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks run enterprise IT stacks but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters. Physical and Industrial AI through the Omniverse and robotics Jensen Huang on the earnings call And then lastly industrial AI. Remember one of the implications of the world reordering if you will is a regions onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories of course there are new electronics manufacturing chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that were doing with robotics is emerging. And so this fourth pillar is quite important. Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems you really have to train a vast amount of data. So back to more data more training more AIs to be created more computers. And so these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge. NeoClouds Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds like Coreweave and Nebius should be a huge business. Lost in all this was Gaming revenue which grew 42% to $3.76 billion 33% above analysts forecasts $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwells product strengths. Auto was another gainer jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.

2025-05-30T14:10:43.386774,2025-05-29T13:48:29,stocks,1ky8r5u,NY Times: Export Controls Are Endangering the Fragile U.S.-China Truce,"Just two-and-a-half weeks after agreeing to suspend tariffs, both countries are using export controls to disrupt each other’s key industries.

After stepping back this month from an escalating and dangerous war of tariffs, the United States and China are now threatening to undermine their uneasy truce.

On May 12, the countries announced after weekend meetings in Geneva that they would suspend most of their recently imposed tariffs. Since then, however, both governments have shown that they are still prepared to wield controls over critical exports as weapons against one another, with moves that are potentially even more damaging to trade and global supply chains.

China has restricted its exports of rare earth magnets, which are crucial for cars, semiconductors, aircraft and many other applications. Close to 90 percent of the world’s rare earth metals, including magnets, are produced in China.

And the United States on May 13 banned the latest semiconductors from Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant. Then on Wednesday, President Trump suspended the shipment of American semiconductors and some aerospace equipment needed for China’s commercial aircraft, the C919, a signature project in China’s push toward economic self-reliance.

The increasing use of export controls by both countries amounts to supply chain warfare, interrupting the flow of key components that the other country must have to operate huge industries that employ large numbers of workers.

Last week, Ford Motor temporarily closed a factory in Chicago that makes Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles after one of its suppliers ran out of the magnets. In most new cars, the magnets are used in dozens of electric motors that operate brake and steering systems, fuel injectors and even power seats.

His healthcare insurance was denied at a critical moment, and there was nowhere to turn.

Then came another loss, the family farm. It had been in my family for generations, built by my great-grandfather’s blood, sweat, and tears. Selling it wasn’t just a financial decision, it felt like closing a chapter of my family history. But with my career as a low-paid government bureaucrat in DC, staying connected to small-town life wasn’t realistic. Now, I find myself questioning whether I made the right choice.

After settling debts and fees, I was left with about $485K. A strange amount, big enough to feel substantial but not enough to secure a decent home for my wife and kids in the city. And beyond the money, I’m still wrestling with grief, not just for my dad but for the farm, for the legacy I let go of.

I have no idea if my dad would be proud of my decision or disappointed that I sold the farm. But after a lot of reflection, I decided to invest in UNH. The irony is heavy. The industry that denied him care is now where I’m putting his legacy. If I’m going to engage with the system financially, I want to be intentional about it.

Before this, I had no savings. We lived paycheck to paycheck in an unforgiving city. But if I want a better future for my wife and kids, I had to make a move. So I YOLO’d into UNH, knowing full well the irony of it all.

The strangest part? My family doesn’t know yet. I haven’t told them, maybe because I’m still processing, maybe because I don’t know how they’d react. Grief, frustration, responsibility. It’s a lot to carry.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Selling something deeply tied to family history, questioning whether it was the right call, and trying to make sense of it through investing? How did you navigate it?

This is a publicly traded, technology-driven company that provides shipping, mailing, and financial services. They serve businesses, enterprises, and government entities with solutions for sending, tracking, and managing mail and parcels.

It is currently priced at a discount to competitors.  The reason for that is because the market thinks it's a dying mail company.  The reality is it is cash cow which has been returning value to shareholders and could have three two reasons to moon.  They recently announced a new CEO who runs a hedge fund that looks for ""deep value.""  You may have heard of one of their investments: the brick and mortar game store.  
  
1: USPS Privatization.  
  
Postmaster general DeJoy resigned in March (tension with Trump).  FedEx board member named new Postmaster General USPS cutting 10k jobs, outsourcing to private sector.  If this USPS really has full or partial privatization, PBI would be looking at major increase in business.  


2: PE Buyout

New CEO Kurt Wolf replaced previous CEO because he wanted more aggressive plans and ""strategic initiatives"".  He has been involved in wallstreet for decades and is connected and looking for return on value as his fund is a major investor.  They have been actively reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheet.  Company has fwd P/E of 7 and should continue to rise with improved cost cutting to focus on core business which makes it a solid attractive target for anyone looking for recurring stable profits.  
  
PBI currently trades at major discount to peers (7x fwd P/E).  This is likely due to its large debt and previous poor earnings last year and the previous stink that surrounds it.  However, wallstreet is starting to notice (as evidenced by its stock already being up significantly after each earnings call.  
  
The Math 📊  
  
If USPS privatized:  
  
Revenue: +25-40% (market share capture)  
  
Earnings: +45-80% (pricing power)  
  
At peer multiples: $50-70/share

At current multiples: $20-35/share  
  
Risks ⚠️  
  
USPS privatization stalls (legal/political), trump still faces resistance in congress.  A recession could kill shipping volumes.  Mail decline accelerates, it is currently losing \~5% revenue yoy.  
  
The Play   
  
Entry: $10-11  
Targets: $20 → $35 → $50+  
  
This is deep value + proven CEO + industry catalyst. Market pricing for failure while fundamentals improving.

The reason for that is because the market thinks its a dying mail company. The reality is it is cash cow which has been returning value to shareholders and could have three two reasons to moon. They recently announced a new CEO who runs a hedge fund that looks for deep value. You may have heard of one of their investments the brick and mortar game store. 1 USPS Privatization. Postmaster general DeJoy resigned in March tension with Trump. FedEx board member named new Postmaster General USPS cutting 10k jobs outsourcing to private sector. If this USPS really has full or partial privatization PBI would be looking at major increase in business. 2 PE Buyout New CEO Kurt Wolf replaced previous CEO because he wanted more aggressive plans and strategic initiatives. He has been involved in wallstreet for decades and is connected and looking for return on value as his fund is a major investor. They have been actively reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheet. Company has fwd PE of 7 and should continue to rise with improved cost cutting to focus on core business which makes it a solid attractive target for anyone looking for recurring stable profits. PBI currently trades at major discount to peers 7x fwd PE. This is likely due to its large debt and previous poor earnings last year and the previous stink that surrounds it. However wallstreet is starting to notice as evidenced by its stock already being up significantly after each earnings call. The Math If USPS privatized Revenue +25-40% market share capture Earnings +45-80% pricing power At peer multiples $50-70share At current multiples $20-35share Risks USPS privatization stalls legalpolitical trump still faces resistance in congress. A recession could kill shipping volumes. Mail decline accelerates it is currently losing 5% revenue yoy.

I’ve been experimenting with a semi-systematic trading framework,not fully automated, but with quant-based filtering to drive decision-making.

Each morning, I run a Python script that screens for:

Overnight range breaks

VWAP deviation thresholds

Volatility clusters (using ATR + historical beta)

Specific liquidity zone setups (based on custom levels, not order book)

Once the list is narrowed down, I manually monitor 5m/15m price action and only take trades if there's confirmation — usually after a second sweep or strong volume divergence.

I know this isn't 100% algo trading, but the quant side gives me a big edge in filtering noise, while the discretionary layer keeps me adaptive. I'm not scalping every tick, just high-probability setups that match the model's bias.

Curious if anyone else here is using hybrid workflows like this. How do you balance systematic signal generation with manual execution?

Not sure if this is too “discretionary” for this sub, but I figured someone here might be exploring something similar. Would be cool to exchange ideas with others doing hybrid workflows.

Here are my trades for the week (only some of them)

Long story short: on past weekend finished my trading infrastructure project that I started few month ago. I named it FLOX. It is written in pure C++ (features from 20 standard used) and consists of building blocks that, in theory, allow users to build trading-related applications: hft systems, trading systems, market data feeds or even TradingView analog.

Project is fully open-source and available at github: [https://github.com/eeiaao/flox](https://github.com/eeiaao/flox)  
There are tests and benchmarks to keep it stable. I tried to document every component and shared high-level overview of this framework in documentation: [https://eeiaao.github.io/flox/](https://eeiaao.github.io/flox/)  
  
I already tried to use it to build hft tick-based strategy and I was impress of how easy it scaling for multiple tickers / exchanges. I think, although cannot commit to, a simple demo project will be rolled out on this weekend. However, at this point I think documentation is complete enough to figure out the main ideas.

Main goal of this project is to provide a clean, robust way to build trading systems. I believe my contribution may help people that passioned about low latency trading systems to build some great stuff in a systematic way.

C++ knowledge is required. I have some thoughts on embedding JS engine to allow write strategies in JavaScript, but that's for the bright future.

Project is open to constructive criticism. Any contributions and ideas are welcome!",Hi dear subredditors.

I tried to document every component and shared high-level overview of this framework in documentation I already tried to use it to build hft tick-based strategy and I was impress of how easy it scaling for multiple tickers exchanges. I think although cannot commit to a simple demo project will be rolled out on this weekend. However at this point I think documentation is complete enough to figure out the main ideas. Main goal of this project is to provide a clean robust way to build trading systems. I believe my contribution may help people that passioned about low latency trading systems to build some great stuff in a systematic way. C++ knowledge is required.

I've developed a few strategies on TradingView that yielded results in risk assets that seemed almost too good to be true. Knowing that the TV backtester is notoriously bad I made a built in backtester which validated the data but without real spreads and fees. Consequently, over a couple of weeks, I converted them to C# for use with cTrader, with the eventual aim of using NinjaTrader if I decide to move into futures.

With cTrader, I find I can benefit from real tick data and rich historical data for backtesting, which also incorporates real fees and spreads. The backtesting has gone well so far. I haven't ""back-fitted"" the strategies using the offered optimization tab; the only parameter changes I make are minor, based on the selected brokers, as most of the strategies rely on CVD and volume.

I wanted to ask algotraders with running algorithms: Am I wasting my time with cTrader? Or, is there a particular reason it is not frequently mentioned, as I never see it discussed in r/algotrading?

Separately, I have one personal concern, particularly as I use these strategies on minor FX pairs: I don't know how the cTrader backtester handles price spikes and rollover spreads at session close. 

Currently looks good on a live account as I have about 2 months with it stable. I am just concerned with the lack of noise around cTrader itself, feels like I might be on the wrong path and want to ease those doubts.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read or comment! :)

Basic setup:
I buy the back-week call, sell the front-week call (same strike, usually ATM)
Only take trades if earnings are after market close
The idea is to let IV crush the short leg post-earnings while the long leg holds more value
I usually exit the next morning as soon as I see the expected spread increase

My scoring system:

I built a custom model that scores each setup out of 100. Here’s what I factor in:
IV Rank
Front IV vs Back IV (Slope)
IV / HV Ratio
Liquidity Score (volume + OI on the strike I’m using)
Stability Score (how often it stays within historical moves)
Days to Earnings
Implied Move / Historical Move
Monte Carlo win rate (based on last 12 earnings vs implied move)

If a ticker scores above ~70, I consider it tradeable. Below that I pass.

Example I’m in right now:

ZS $255 calendar spread
Bought at $1.45 per contract (11)
Front IV: 121%, Back IV: 64%
Simulated opening value tomorrow: ~$3.00
Risk: $1,595 (11 contracts)
Target: ~2x return or more

What I’m looking for:

What am I missing from the model?
Any useful metrics you’d add?
Anyone here automated this kind of setup before (Polygon.io, Python, etc.)?
Would you ever pick strikes away from ATM or just keep it simple?

Appreciate any ideas or feedback.

*the strategy*

The strategy is actually pretty simple. It doenst use any complex indicator or anything like that. I use just moving averages and got profits more than 10.000 % buy and hold profits 
The indicator doebst matter, the only thing that truly matters is how you handle the indicators. After some data analyzing I noticed that when you invert the moving avareges they start to predict the market very well. Instead of rolling from the first to last, you roll from last element of df to first, and when this inverted MA is above price it means you should buy because the price is moving up soon.

I called it ""Upside Down MA"" or UDMA. I hope y'all make good use of this new simple(but efficient indicator) and that we continue to trade and share learning materials that improve our lives.

**Number of Tickers Analyzed:** 54

**Analysis Approach**  
• Gap & Momentum: Ranked by absolute Post\_Gap\_% for potential rapid swings.  
• Liquidity Filter: Required Volume ≥150% of 10-day average to ensure fast entry/exit.  
• Pivot Zones: Noted proximity to 52-week highs/lows for breakout/breakdown setups.  
• News Catalysts: Weighted recent news sentiment (bullish or bearish) to spotlight intraday drivers.  
• Earnings & Insider Signals: Tagged stocks with upcoming earnings (within 14 days) and recent insider buys/sells (last 7 days) as added catalysts.

**Ranked Stock Highlights**

1. **APDN (9.8)** • Massive +33.3% post-market gap, Volume 158% avg – explosive intraday move potential • Trades just above 52-week low ($0.32), ready for both mean-reversion and continuation plays
2. **ZEO (9.6)** • –14.0% gap on news of $10M Heliogen acquisition, Volume >770k% avg – prime for volatility • Strong bullish M&A sentiment; ideal for gap-fill or momentum scalps
3. **HBIO (9.4)** • –13.4% gap, Volume >112k% avg – extreme liquidity and sell-off volatility • Trades near 52-week low ($0.28) – high-risk, high-reward breakdown candidate
4. **ELPW (9.2)** • –13.3% gap, Volume 446% avg – heavy overnight weakness • Negative news from [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) weak earnings; potential for short-covering or snap-back scalps
5. **TRUG (9.0)** • –11.8% gap, Volume >3,500% avg – sharp reversal risk • Bullish catalyst: $2M share repurchase program announced – watch for a bounce
6. **IMCC (8.8)** • +6.6% gap, Volume >77,000% avg – strong upside momentum • Approaching 52-week high ($6.00 at $4.99) – breakout candidate

8. **WETO (8.4)** • +5.4% gap, Volume >45,000% avg – strong liquidity • Mid-range, no news – pure momentum play
9. **SBET (8.2)** • +1.9% gap, Volume 203% avg – solid liquidity with uptrend bias • Multiple bullish headlines on Ethereum treasury strategy – momentum tailwind
10. **STRM (8.0)** • –0.4% gap, Volume >33,000% avg – extreme liquidity although muted gap • Upcoming earnings (06/09) and merger news; watch for volatility ahead of report

**Catalyst Highlights**

• M&A: ZEO (Heliogen), STRM (merger)  
• Share Repurchase: TRUG  
• Strategic Treasury Shift: SBET  
• Extreme Insider Buys: (none in top 10); monitor if appear

**Additional Observations**  
• Ultra-low-float names (HBIO, ZEO, APDN, ELPW) offer rapid swings but wide spreads – use limit orders  
• High-volume uniform movers (IMCC, MODV, WETO) suit both trend-following and snap-back scalps  
• Keep an eye on pre-market/first-hour momentum for entries; manage risk tightly on gap fades",Disclaimer The generation of this watchlist is automated using a combination of python scripts trusted financial APIs i.e. Finnhub Alphavantage etc. AI Agents and LLMs local purpose built and OpenAIs API.

If you want to be consistently profitable trader, learn to put down the trade, your journal is a trashcan to dump it out. Your trade plan is just a review of your system and rules. Take the trade and then let go when it’s over. Too many times I see attachment issues post trade.

Your system needs to allow you to buy and sell without attachment through out the entire execution to cool down. Once you figure this out you’ll be a life long winner and rich.

Hi, im not sure how to start here but i need help with optimizing a trading strategy thati have been working on for months. i really think this strategy can work to be really profitable but just in the extra push or eyes or figuring out how.

I learned this strategy through another group that had a very high win rate, however their strategy depends on how advance you were with a-lot of different confluences.

I wanted to simplify it a bit and from my results i was able to 2x my account multiple times in a few days, but the downside is one lost can set you back pretty badly. The RR isn't great but due to the higher win rate it makes up for it, as long as you have a good set up.

My problem is i can't narrow down to what is considered a bad set up. I have a video of the strategy if you want to dm me i can send it over, and also I have the strategy written out. Its pretty extensive but would love to have someone work together in building this to be profitable.

I really like this strategy because it gives you multiple times to get me out of the trade in profit before a lost.

[THIS IS THE SETUP. USING FIBONACCI](https://preview.redd.it/r66fx98ast3f1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2a6d83762e90486dfb890876819baa18d70d5ab)



5‑min strategy that uses impulsive price swings, fair‑value gaps (FVGs), Fibonacci retracements/extensions, and EMA alignment to enter trending moves with a multi‑layered limit order approach. 

1. Entry Conditions

Timeframe & Structure:

15 min chart, cross‑check your Fib levels and structure on the 1 h chart.

Identify a clear channel (up or down).

Impulse & Fair‑Value Gap

Look for an impulsive wave of ≥ 3 consecutive candles moving in one direction that breaks the prior macro higher‑high (HH) or lower‑low (LL).

This swing must leave an on‑chart fair‑value gap (FVG) on the higher timeframe.

EMA Alignment:

EMAs (20, 50, 200) must be stacked and spreading in the direction of the impulse.

On the 1 h chart, price must not be touching or rejecting off the 200 EMA (to avoid major resistance/support).

Fibonacci Setup:

Draw Fibonacci from the start of the impulsive candle to its end, but set the 0.0 level at the impulse origin (just before the first strong candle).

Use the 0.17 retracement (rather than 0.0) as your “zero” when precision reaction is seen there. FVG origin becomes Fib 0.17.

Ensure Fib 1.0 keeps extending beyond 1.0 (price hasn’t already reversed before reaching the 1.0 extension), and watch for a retracement toward Fib 0.382.

Confirm that the EMA (20/50/200) lies within the Fib zone.

2. Order Levels (Limit Entries, TP & SL)

Three‑tier limit order (DCA) approach, with position sizing stepped at factors:

Tier Fib Level & Action

Entry 1 Place 1 × size at Fib 0.382 (or first reaction zone)

Entry 2 Place 3 × at next deeper Fib (e.g., 0.618)  

Entry 3 Final 5 × size at Fib 0.825–1.000 (depending on your precise FVG origin)

Take‑Profit (TP):

Placed at the impulse origin (the Fib 0.17 “zero” point), effectively just beyond the FVG. (Must confirm this)

If hit, limit orders are canceled. Likewise, filling a TP cancels remaining orders.

3. Exit Conditions

Full Exits (TPs): at the next FIB

Full Exit (SL): A break back through the impulse origin/“zero” invalidates the setup—exit all and cancel any unfilled orders.

Time‑based Exit: Most trades resolve within 2–5 h. If a TP isn’t hit within 24 h, manual exiti near breakeven or tightening the SL to protect capital. (confirm

4. Risk Management

Account Risk per Trade: clarify

Position Sizing: The 1‑3‑5 weighting increases win‑rate probability but amplifies losses.

Range Targets: Favor setups where the full multi‑tier range (Entry to final TP) is > 1.5 % but < 6–8 % of price—too tight invites noise; too wide drags out trades.

EMA Filter: Avoid trades where the 15 min 200 EMA (or 1 h 200 EMA) directly opposes the trend or is about to be tested.

5. Strategy Characteristics

Trend‑Continuation Focus: Designed to catch strong continuations after a breakout HH/LL. 

Avoid Consolidation & “Reversal” Signals: Skip setups with ragged or non‑consecutive candles, double tops/bottoms, or where EMAs are flattening or crossing against the trend.

This strategy is over when either or happens. Take profit or stop loss. 

For example if limit 1 triggers it can either go to tp or go to the next limit order. 

Limit 2 order can either go to tp (which is now where limit 1 was) or go to limit 3 (not stop loss bc it will trigger limit 3 first)

Limit 3 order now can either go to tp at where limit 2 was or hit sl. 

sl is at which is at -.05 not 0.0",Please dm if you want to work together on this.

Only a 42% win rate overall.  Hell, this entire year has been a bit of a struggle for me relative to last year.  Very tough to trade.  
  
But I stuck to my daily plan, sized correctly (most days), and cut losers fast which I am happy with.  Had a few big days which essentially saved the month for me.

Biggest lesson?  
You don’t need to be perfect.  
You just need to respect risk and let your edge do the work.

I am not here to brag.  9k relative to many other traders is peanuts, I know many making 10k/day.  But I work full time and trade around my career and this brings me a some nice additional income.  I began trading for me to at least have a Plan B in place if things did not work out with my career which they have luckily, and I am grateful for that.

If you are struggling....I hope this gives you some inspiration :)

Manage your risk first!!!

Instead of just tracking entries and exits, I’ve started writing a short breakdown of each trade: what I saw, why I took it, what went right or wrong, and what I learned from it. I don’t overthink it. I just write it like I’m explaining the trade to myself, where I entered, how I managed it, what I could’ve done better.

This simple habit has helped me stay honest, spot mistakes, and slowly build more confidence in my process. Even on the days I don’t trade well, journaling gives me clarity instead of frustration.

Here’s an example from today. I’ll drop screenshots below.

During the session, I also write down brief notes on what I’m watching and why I’m considering certain setups.

I’ve been trading NQ futures with Apex funded trading for about 8 months now. I’ve had 4 or 5 payouts, and while that might sound decent, I’m overall just about break-even when you factor in all the evaluation accounts I’ve purchased.

Earlier this week, I got an email from Apex saying I was being considered for live funding—which sounded great. But then they followed up saying they want to keep me on SIM and asked for a full strategy write-up, including:
	•	My exact entry rules
	•	Initial stop and take profit
	•	Trailing stop method
	•	Indicators I use
	•	Any software or auto trading systems
	•	And 5 days of screenshots with marked-up charts showing I follow my system to the T

Honestly, this seems kinda wack. I don’t think any other prop firm asks for this level of detail, and it got me thinking…

Should I just switch to trading options on TOS? My strategy works and I have some prior experience with options. ",Hello Ive been trading NQ futures with Apex funded trading for about 8 months now.

2025-05-30T14:10:43.386774,2025-05-30T02:29:21,Daytrading,1kyqqxi,My Journey through KCU(Somesh) - Kay Capitals University,"
## The Beginning
When I first encountered Kay Capitals University, the promise was intoxicating. Sleek Instagram posts showcased a lifestyle of financial freedom, with Somesh, the charismatic founder, presenting day trading as the ultimate path to wealth. The marketing was masterful—carefully curated images of luxury cars, exotic locations, and seemingly effortless trading success. For an aspiring trader hungry for transformation, the $3,000 course seemed like a small price to pay for potential financial liberation.

## The Initial Glimpse of Hope
The first few weeks offered a tantalizing hint of possibility. Glossy video modules introduced trading concepts with a veneer of professional expertise. The Discord community buzzed with excitement, filled with selected success stories and motivational rhetoric. I found myself believing that I was on the cusp of something extraordinary—a secret trading methodology that could unlock financial potential.

## The Daily Reality Behind the Curtain

What did six months with Kay Capitals University actually look like? Monday through Friday, we gathered for trading sessions from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM at most. During these “live sessions,” students could only see Somesh’s TradingView chart—never his actual trading account. While he constantly claimed to be “reading the candles” with expert precision, the reality was far less impressive. His predictions worked approximately half the time—essentially the same odds as a coin flip.

We were also given access to video modules through his website, which were supposedly teaching his proprietary “strategies”—though “tricks” would be a more accurate description. These videos repackaged basic trading concepts available for free online, dressed up with fancy terminology and presented as revolutionary insights. The entire trading methodology boiled down to four simple steps: plot support and resistance levels, trade with the trend, look for candle breakouts, and manage stop losses. Nothing extraordinary—certainly nothing that justifies a $3,000 price tag.

The most dangerous aspect was how vulnerable students like myself became fixated on Somesh’s reported high-profit trades. Not only these impressive numbers occurred less frequently, but what he failed to emphasize was the massive capital required to generate such returns. To achieve the profit amounts he boasted about, you’d need to risk substantial sums—often $10,000 or more could vanish instantly when stop losses were triggered. The psychological impact of seeing these “successful” trades without understanding the enormous risk exposure was devastating to student decision-making.

In short, there was no magical formula or secret insight—just educated guesses based on general experience that anyone could develop through basic technical chart familiarity. After each session, Somesh would share screenshots of his supposed profits alongside “success stories” from select members. This raised an obvious question: were these actual trading profits from real accounts, or simply theoretical gains from paper trading? Occasionally, he would post videos showing profits from what appeared to be a live trading account, but there’s no way to verify if those funds were actually generated from trading or simply deposited to create an impression of success.

Sundays featured one to two-hour sessions focused primarily on trading psychology, “jam sessions,” and Q&A periods where he would answer student questions. These sessions were heavy on motivation, psychology and somewhat on actionable strategy. Everything of substance could have been learned from freely available trading books and YouTube videos. The real focus was always on psychology—not because it’s the secret to trading success, but because it’s conveniently subjective and impossible to quantify or refute.

## The Harsh Economic Reality
The true nature of the business model became increasingly clear. With over 500,000 Instagram followers, the mathematics was brutal. If even 2.5% of followers purchased the $3,000 course, that's a potential $37.5 million revenue stream. The course wasn't designed to create successful traders—it was engineered to create a perpetual revenue machine. The final blow came when I realized the six-month access was deliberately designed to expire, with an additional $1,500 required to continue ""learning."" What followed was a masterclass in high-pressure sales tactics. When I hesitated at this new cost, Somesh immediately offered a convenient monthly installments of $500—a transparent attempt to extract whatever money possible from students already invested in the system.

Even more revealing was what happened next. If you continued to resist the renewal, the price would suddenly drop again—this time to a ""lifetime Discord access"" for just $100. This desperate cascade of diminishing offers exposed the true value proposition. If the education was truly worth $3,000 initially, and the continued access worth $1,500, how could it suddenly be worth only $100? This manipulative pricing strategy revealed that after extracting $3,000 from students, Somesh would employ any tactic to secure additional revenue, regardless of how pathetic or transparent the attempt.

## The Community Manipulation
What once seemed like a supportive community revealed itself as a carefully orchestrated illusion. Positive comments were subtly encouraged, with students encouraged to share ""success stories"" and create social media buzz. Struggling students told they lacked the right mindset.

## The Money-Back Mirage
The advertised money-back guarantee proved to be nothing more than a marketing tactic. Attempts to seek refunds were met with increasingly complex demands for back-testing documentation, trading logs, and proof of ""perfect"" strategy implementation. The guarantee was a maze designed to frustrate and discourage anyone seeking accountability.

## The Final Revelation
In the end, Kay Capitals University exposed itself as something far removed from a legitimate trading education. It was a masterclass in marketing, selling hope and lifestyle dreams to eager, financially vulnerable students. The real skill being taught wasn’t trading—it was the art of creating an illusion of success.

## A Warning to Aspiring Traders

To those dreaming of financial freedom through day trading, understand this: True trading education doesn’t come with a glamorous lifestyle promise. It requires genuine skill, continuous learning, and an understanding that no single course can guarantee success. Be wary of educators more focused on selling a dream than teaching a craft.

Perhaps the most revealing question is this: If Somesh is truly the trading genius he claims to be, why would he spend so much time and effort selling courses? The answer is simple economics—selling hope to aspiring traders is far more profitable and significantly less risky than day trading itself. While markets fluctuate unpredictably, the steady stream of eager students provides a consistent revenue stream without any of the risks associated with actual trading.

##final note of caution: 
If you see this review suddenly bombarded with positive feedback and glowing testimonials about Kay Capitals University, take a wild guess who sent them. The coordinated defense of his reputation is part of the business model.

Right now bitcoin dominance is at 63%, on the same date in 2021, it was at 43.1%, and at the same date even in 2017 it was at 48.7%.

This is in sharp contrast with the general expected trend, where bitcoin dominance tends to go down over time with the introduction of more and more altcoins with various use cases, better technology etc.

I personally liked Cardano for example, because of its approach with peer reviewed scientific research and the fact that it was always proof-of-stake (I don't like when cryptos waste too much electricity). But, my ""beloved"" Cardano seems to be a shadow of its former self. In 2021 it went from one strength to another, and right now, not only is it ""growing"" slower than in 2021, it is actually is almost 50% cheaper than at the same time in 2017. Right now it's at $0.7 and at the same time in 2021 it was at $1.57. So it's more than twice as cheap now than 4 years ago! In crypto-world this pretty much means you're dead.

If we take into account a significant inflation of prices in USD over last 4 years, the finding is even more striking. If inflation was taken into account, we could easily say that Cardano is now maybe even 70% cheaper than 4 years ago.

But this post is not about Cardano, Cardano is just an example.

What I'm trying to say is that alts are pretty much cooked. And it is worse than it seems. Bitcoin dominance right now would be way higher if stablecoins weren't counted among alts. They are counted among alts, even though they probably aren't typical cryptos at all. Without stablecoins, bitcoin dominance would be even more extreme. Right now, among top 10 cryptos 2 are stablecoins: tether and USDC, with Tether at solid 3rd position and on its way to overtake Ethereum in market capitalization.

Now, at first glance, this seems great for bitcoin. It's been proven that altcoins are in fact ""shitcoins"", that bitcoin is the king, and that all the rest is just noise.

But I disagree. Many altcoins were serious projects with solid use cases, good technology, and definite value proposition. And yet all of that failed to hold value on the market. Seems that the real world, in spite of the best intentions and efforts of some altcoin projects, simply doesn't need this type of product and service yet. It seems that altcoins, if we are really frank about it, provided solutions for non-existent problems. They were ""solutions in search of a problem"". And their stellar rise was the result of pure speculation. Once the bubble burst, it burst for good.

So my conclusion is that altcoins, even though many of them were serious and had solid tech, and weren't ""shitcoins"" at all, failed simply because there's no real need for them in the real world.

Now let's go back to bitcoin. If altcoins failed big way like that, what does it mean to bitcoin? I think it's not a good sign. It just proves that the whole idea of blockchain and cryptocurrency was overhyped. The real world doesn't need crypto. Full stop. And bitcoin is not an exception. Many alts have many advantages over bitcoin, and yet they failed. They failed because the world mostly doesn't need crypto.

So why bitcoin didn't fail yet?

Well, signs of failure are already on the horizon.

First of all, its growth is significantly slowing down. This cycle is way weaker than the last one, and all of this is happening during under the most pro-crypto US administration ever. During previous cycles US government was at best neutral, or it leaned against crypto. This current government is extremely pro-crypto. Bitcoin ETFs are mainstream. Blackrock buys bitcoin. The president himself hypes it.

This is IMO, peak hype. I can't imagine more hype than this. This is a concentrated effort of bitcoin maximalists and crypto lobbyists to influence the government and ***to promote bitcoin itself***, as some sort of asset that will by some magic bring about utopia. The narrative has significantly shifted in the direction of bitcoin maximalism. So, it's hype, hype, hype. Hype squared. Hype cubed.

But what if, beneath all that hype, bitcoin is really just like alts? Beneath all the hype, bitcoin is an asset that the world doesn't really need. Its only real value proposition is ""moon narrative"". All the rest is bullshit or rationalization for investing into get-rich-quick scheme.

So I feel that beneath all the hype bitcoin is actually quite weak and in a dangerous situation right now. The hype can't go on forever. People will get bored of it, it will grow old. Besides, the price can't always keep rising. This cycle is already quite weak. The next one will be even weaker. The slower the price rises, the harder it is to sell the moon narrative. People won't believe anymore. The more time passes, the less plausible is the ""we're still early"" mantra.

Hype can keep the whole thing going for a while, but I think, we're already seeing beginning of the end.",This seems to be the first 4-year cycle in which we are already in the middle of the year in which the peak of the cycle is expected like 2013 2017 and 2021 with no signs of significant alt season whatsoever. Right now bitcoin dominance is at 63% on the same date in 2021 it was at 43.1% and at the same date even in 2017 it was at 48.7%. This is in sharp contrast with the general expected trend where bitcoin dominance tends to go down over time with the introduction of more and more altcoins with various use cases better technology etc. I personally liked Cardano for example because of its approach with peer reviewed scientific research and the fact that it was always proof-of-stake I dont like when cryptos waste too much electricity. But my beloved Cardano seems to be a shadow of its former self. In 2021 it went from one strength to another and right now not only is it growing slower than in 2021 it is actually is almost 50% cheaper than at the same time in 2017. Right now its at $0.7 and at the same time in 2021 it was at $1.57. So its more than twice as cheap now than 4 years ago In crypto-world this pretty much means youre dead. If we take into account a significant inflation of prices in USD over last 4 years the finding is even more striking. If inflation was taken into account we could easily say that Cardano is now maybe even 70% cheaper than 4 years ago. But this post is not about Cardano Cardano is just an example. What Im trying to say is that alts are pretty much cooked. And it is worse than it seems. Bitcoin dominance right now would be way higher if stablecoins werent counted among alts. They are counted among alts even though they probably arent typical cryptos at all. Without stablecoins bitcoin dominance would be even more extreme.

I’m sharing a detailed update on a project my team and I are working on. If you’re not into long posts, feel free to skip, but if you’re curious about crypto, stablecoins, or athlete tokenization, read on!

# What We’re Building

We’re creating an overcollateralized stablecoin tied to the AED (UAE Dirham) to serve as a security asset in liquidity pools for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens tied to athletes’ careers.

In simple terms, athletes can tokenize their careers into shares, allowing fans and investors to own a fraction of their future earnings (like a manager’s cut).

Investors in these athlete governance tokens can earn passive income from the athlete’s salary and influence their career decisions.

Our ultimate goal is to have our stablecoin secure the liquidity pools for these athlete tokens, creating a new way for athletes to monetize their careers and for fans to engage with sports.

# Where We Are Now (V1):

* **Tech**: We’ve built V1 on Polkadot’s parachain using smart contracts with Proof of Authority (POA). For now, we’re using USDT for transactions to test the use case.
* **Platform**: We’ve launched a sports-focused social media network to help athletes connect with brands, secure sponsorships, and grow their audience. Regular users can watch live streams of smaller leagues, access sports content, and (once tokenized) chat with athletes they invest in to propose career moves.
* **Traction**: Over 100 athletes are onboard, including Erko Jun (1.3M Instagram followers) and other pro athletes, mainly from combat sports. New athletes join regularly, excited to tokenize their careers.
* **Social Media Growth**: Our platform is growing toward a goal of 1M users by year-end. Ads are running, partnerships are forming, and we’re on track.
* **Legal**: We’ve registered our company in Dubai and are pursuing a crypto license through VARA (Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) to operate legally. All operations are moving to Dubai.

# Team & Funding

* 27 full-time employees, all in-house (developers, marketers, etc.—no outsourcing!).
* Secured investment with a 3-year runway to execute our vision.
* A few investors are ready to back our stablecoin development next year.

# Next Steps

* 2025: Complete V1, launch fractional ownership of athlete careers in Dubai under VARA regulations.
* 2026: Build our own blockchain and launch the AED-pegged stablecoin. We plan to issue 1B tokens, backed by 1B AED in a bank as collateral, plus our company’s assets for overcollateralization.

# Why I’m Posting

We’re looking for crypto enthusiasts to join our platform, test it, and share feedback to shape what we’re building. Right now, you can:

* Download our app (available on Google Play and App Store).
* Earn points in the app, which will convert 1:1 to our crypto token later.
* Join our community to discuss the project (the platform has chat and group features).

21 million will be in supply after like 2142 or whatever year the jetson’s are in.

If satoshi holds 1/4 of the total supply, which prolly won’t be touched and until now, retail and miners, exchanges have had the other 14 milly bitties in circulation. 

What happens when institutions and the top ten holders end up owning almost 3/4 of the supply by 2026? 

Especially since retail is mostly selling to institutions. Exchanges are hoarding btc. Companies are now accepting btc. 

How long until the public holds less than 1/5 of the supply while the top 10-20 players capture the most of the supply?

After 2026, only 1 million btc to go. But if the top 10-20 hold almost 3/4 the supply already from buying and sotoshi’s 1/4 won’t ever be touched. What difference does that 1 milly make? 

Are we being robbed in plain sight for them to take control of another industry we all wanted crypto to stand for?

Long enough to see the rugs, the hype coins with no heart, the “communities” that vanish overnight. But every now and then, something different shows up. For me, that was $HEGE

I got in pretty early, before most people were paying attention. Watched it grow from $6M to $50M like it was nothing. But the price action wasn’t even the biggest thing for me. What stood out was how real the community is.

The Telegram is active 24/7, people are actually building stuff, memeing, helping each other out. The dev is in there every day, not hiding, not disappearing, just delivering. And now? Things are heating up.

-Rumors about Gate.io listing

-$200k marketing budget being deployed

-Constant contests where the team actually pays people for creating stuff

-Influencers, billboards, raids, memes, you name it — it’s all happening right now

Let’s not forget the Hegends NFTs. 2,222 of them, sold out in less then 2 days, and they’ve been paying out dividends since day one. The floor is still strong and people are holding — that says a lot.

And the team? Holds less than 5% of supply. Hege is a registered company. Fully listed on BitMart, Toobit, INDOEX, LBANK, AscendEX and MEXC.

I’ve seen many coins come and go. Some pump, most die. But Hege? Hege builds. Through every dip, through every market move, the community holds the line. Not just for gains, but because we actually give a sh*t.

I’ve never sold a single $HEGE. Still holding. Still proud to be part of this.

If you’re new here, take a look around. Join the TG. Scroll through the subreddit. Feel the energy. Then ask yourself: “When was the last time I saw this kind of loyalty in crypto?”

This isn’t just another meme. This is $HEGE. And we’re only just getting started.

2025-05-30T14:10:43.386774,2025-05-30T08:34:48,CryptoMarkets,1kyxd6l,Looking to discuss about RWA Crypto-kinda tokens.,"Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how underexposed my portfolio is to RWA tokens.. and I don’t mean the flashy kind riding on buzzwords, I mean legit, yield-bearing, asset-tied crypto that’s bridging TradFi and DeFi in a meaningful way..

I’ve mostly been deep in memes, utility tokens, some staking plays, and a fair bit of governance experiments but not much that really touches the real world.. And yeah.. that used to be fine when the whole space was about narratives and liquidity flows. But if we’re being honest, the cycle’s evolving. People are slowly caring more about revenue models, sustainable yield, and actual off-chain tie-ins.

So I’m now actively looking for crypto projects with proper RWA utility. Think tokenized T-bills, real estate funds, invoice factoring, shipping containers (stuff that earns outside of pure Ponzi dynamics). I want tokens that don’t just rely on hype and rebases, but have access to yield that doesn’t collapse the moment there is the hype slows downm.

Not saying I’m going full TradFi maxi, I’m still a degen at heart.. but diversifying into RWA feels like the missing puzzle piece in my broader allocation. Especially if we get more regulatory clarity and big players start tokenizing real assets en masse (which, let’s face it, is already happening quietly).

The issue is, a lot of RWA projects either suck at marketing, or they’re overpromising on what they actually deliver. So I’m trying to cut through the noise and find stuff with:

• legit asset backing (I don’t care for vague “secured” claims),

• real-world income streams,

• and sustainable token models that don’t depend on looping or mercenary capital.

If anyone’s deep in this space or knows underrated RWA gems, I’m all ears. Preferably on chains that aren’t totally dead in terms of activity.. Bonus if the project has a functioning UI and isn’t stuck in “soon” mode.

Might even spin this into a dedicated RWA watchlist if there's enough alpha to dig into. Been sleeping on this corner of crypto too long tbh.

Let’s build a thread of RWA tokens worth looking into.. not paid shills, just good-faith breakdowns..

Do share and feel free to discuss them.. :D",Lately Ive been thinking a lot about how underexposed my portfolio is to RWA tokens.. and I dont mean the flashy kind riding on buzzwords I mean legit yield-bearing asset-tied crypto thats bridging TradFi and DeFi in a meaningful way..

I’m sharing a detailed update on a project my team and I are working on. If you’re not into long posts, feel free to skip, but if you’re curious about crypto, stablecoins, or athlete tokenization, read on!

# What We’re Building

We’re creating an overcollateralized stablecoin tied to the AED (UAE Dirham) to serve as a security asset in liquidity pools for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokens tied to athletes’ careers.

In simple terms, athletes can tokenize their careers into shares, allowing fans and investors to own a fraction of their future earnings (like a manager’s cut).

Investors in these athlete governance tokens can earn passive income from the athlete’s salary and influence their career decisions.

Our ultimate goal is to have our stablecoin secure the liquidity pools for these athlete tokens, creating a new way for athletes to monetize their careers and for fans to engage with sports.

# Where We Are Now (V1):

* **Tech**: We’ve built V1 on Polkadot’s parachain using smart contracts with Proof of Authority (POA). For now, we’re using USDT for transactions to test the use case.
* **Platform**: We’ve launched a sports-focused social media network to help athletes connect with brands, secure sponsorships, and grow their audience. Regular users can watch live streams of smaller leagues, access sports content, and (once tokenized) chat with athletes they invest in to propose career moves.
* **Traction**: Over 100 athletes are onboard, including Erko Jun (1.3M Instagram followers) and other pro athletes, mainly from combat sports. New athletes join regularly, excited to tokenize their careers.
* **Social Media Growth**: Our platform is growing toward a goal of 1M users by year-end. Ads are running, partnerships are forming, and we’re on track.
* **Legal**: We’ve registered our company in Dubai and are pursuing a crypto license through VARA (Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) to operate legally. All operations are moving to Dubai.

# Team & Funding

* 27 full-time employees, all in-house (developers, marketers, etc.—no outsourcing!).
* Secured investment with a 3-year runway to execute our vision.
* A few investors are ready to back our stablecoin development next year.

# Next Steps

* 2025: Complete V1, launch fractional ownership of athlete careers in Dubai under VARA regulations.
* 2026: Build our own blockchain and launch the AED-pegged stablecoin. We plan to issue 1B tokens, backed by 1B AED in a bank as collateral, plus our company’s assets for overcollateralization.

# Why I’m Posting

We’re looking for crypto enthusiasts to join our platform, test it, and share feedback to shape what we’re building. Right now, you can:

* Download our app (available on Google Play and App Store).
* Earn points in the app, which will convert 1:1 to our crypto token later.
* Join our community to discuss the project (the platform has chat and group features).

How do you store or manage your Seeds or QR Code that gives access to the wallet signature?

Context:

A conventional hardware wallet stores the seedphrase cryptographically in memory. So, to sign a transaction, just turn on the wallet and everything is ready. Your paper or metal backup can be very well stored in hard-to-reach places without any problems. These backups will be rarely used because your wallet is already configured.

A seedsigner loses its memory when it is turned off, so every time you sign, you will need the QR to give access to the wallet. The problem is that this QR can be used frequently and needs to be in a very safe place (if it is lost/stolen, goodbye to the funds).

On the one hand, the fragile part, which are the backup cards, are very safe and protected, on the other, they need to have great protection and easy access at the same time.

Yes, I can simply use a passphrase!

1944.  Post WW2 wtf are we gonna do to reconstruct the world.  World powers decide to make the relatively unharmed US back the new global reserve currency of the dollar.  Dollar will be redeemable for gold.  US will run trade deficits to get the needed dollars into the world, world will rebuild their infrastructure and invest in US treasuries.  US asset prices get a huge bid from this global demand, at the cost of outsourcing industry abroad and racking up debt.

1971.  Doubt arises whether the US has been cheating by printing dollars that aren't backed by gold.  Rather than prove this wrong and returning the promised gold for dollars, Nixon ""suspends"" redeemability and the unbacked fiat global reserve currency era begins.  The world doesn't collapse because as bitcoiners know, money doesn't need to be redeemable, it's a game theory / network effect phenomenon where societies gravitate towards a single winner.

Current status of the fiat dollar reserve currency experiment.

⸻

“For most of human history, money was a side effect of military operations.”
— David Graeber, Debt: The First 5,000 Years

⸻

The Army and the Mint

Empire, money, and a strange new echo in the age of Bitcoin

There’s a pattern that keeps showing up in history—one of those deep structural rhythms that cuts across time, technology, and ideology.

For most of human civilization, when new money is created—whether stamped metal or spreadsheet entries—it tends to follow the same basic structure:
	1.	Money is minted
	2.	Soldiers are paid
	3.	Those soldiers circulate the money into society—by force or by presence

⸻

I. The Ancient Pattern

(where money begins)

In Debt: The First 5,000 Years, anthropologist David Graeber makes a compelling case that money didn’t emerge from barter. It came from empire.

Ancient states minted coins to pay armies. Those armies marched, conquered land, enslaved labor, and extracted resources. The resources came home, were melted down, and turned into more coins. The cycle repeated.

Coinage paid for war. War returned resources. The mint struck more coinage.

The army didn’t just defend the state—it distributed its money. It was the original mechanism of monetary circulation.

You can see this in:
	•	Lydia, where stamped coinage first appeared
	•	Athens, where silver from the Laurium mines paid hoplites
	•	Rome, where legions were issued denarii and spread them across Europe and the Middle East
	•	Later, colonial powers, which demanded taxes payable only in imperial currency, forcing participation in their money systems

Graeber’s insight is that money was never just a market tool. It was a system of power and order, always tethered to a state’s ability to project force.

⸻

II. The American Machine

(debt, war, and the global dollar system)

The form changed. The pattern didn’t.

After WWII, the United States assumed global hegemony. But instead of minting coins, it issued debt—Treasury bonds that functioned as the base layer of the modern monetary system.

Nations bought our debt. We used the proceeds to fund:
	•	Military bases in over 70 countries
	•	Proxy wars (Vietnam, Afghanistan, Nicaragua)
	•	Direct invasions (Iraq, Panama, Libya)
	•	Covert operations and surveillance programs run by a sprawling intelligence apparatus

Debt became our coinage. The military remained the delivery mechanism.

We absorbed goods from around the world and returned digital IOUs. Those IOUs were backed not by gold, but by a system that included the world’s most powerful navy, intelligence network, and defense economy.

As Jack Ma once said: America spent 40 years absorbing the world’s value—and used it to fund wars.

Austrian economists like Mises and Hayek warned that fiat money would distort incentives and lead to unchecked expansion. Modern Monetary Theorists embraced it. But either way, the architecture stayed consistent:

Debt pays for force. Force protects the debt.

It is elegant, extractive, and invisible to most people.
And it still rests on the old triangle: the mint, the army, the loop.

⸻

III. Bitcoin and the Return of Cost

(a new architecture with an old shape)

And now we have Bitcoin.

At first glance, it looks like a clean break. Stateless. Borderless. Nonviolent. Just code.

But look more closely, and the structure reappears.

Bitcoin also issues currency—on a fixed schedule. And like every monetary system before it, that new money goes first to a specific group.

Not to a king.
Not to a central bank.
To a set of actors we call miners.

But “miners” isn’t quite right. They aren’t digging. They aren’t finding.

They’re fighting.

Miners are more accurately described as sentries—defenders who burn real-world energy in a constant, zero-sum battle for the right to write the next block of history.

Every 10 minutes, they:
	•	Compete
	•	Consume power
	•	Validate time
	•	Prove cost

And the winner is rewarded with freshly minted bitcoin.

Every single bitcoin in existence was first paid to a sentry.

There is no central issuance. No grants. No shortcuts.

This echoes the ancient structure:
	•	The money is minted through work
	•	It is issued first to the defenders
	•	It enters society through those defenders’ hands

But there’s a key difference:
	•	No violence
	•	No conquest
	•	No ruler
	•	No territory
	•	Just rules, energy, and math

Bitcoin is a monetary-military protocol.
But instead of bullets, it uses watts.
Instead of conquest, it uses cost.

This resonates not just with history, but with Austrian principles of sound money:
	•	Scarce
	•	Costly to produce
	•	Incorruptible by decree

And it aligns, strangely, with something older than economics: the idea that legitimacy must be earned—through sacrifice, not promise.

Epilogue: The Shape of Power

(Graeber, Lowery, and the convergence)

Reading Debt changed how I think about money.

Reading Softwar, Jason Lowery’s thesis on Bitcoin as a tool of power projection, changed how I think about Bitcoin.

Graeber starts in the ancient world: armies, coins, force.
Lowery starts in the emerging world: machines, energy, proof-of-work.

But they’re not talking about different things. They’re describing the same shape.

Graeber: money has always been downstream of military structure.
Lowery: Bitcoin is a new form of nonviolent warfare—a defensive energy projection protocol.

And when you hold both in your mind, something clicks.

Bitcoin doesn’t reject the historical logic of money.
It mirrors it—just without the blood.

It preserves the essential structure:
	•	A mint
	•	A defense mechanism
	•	A circulation pathway

But it removes the king.
It removes the nation.
It removes the gun.

⸻

This isn’t a manifesto. It’s not a forecast. It’s just a recognition:

Bitcoin doesn’t change the game.
It reveals what the game has always been.

And for the first time in human history,
the army is global,
the mint is open,
and the ledger defends itself.
",For most of human history money was a side effect of military operations. David Graeber Debt The First 5000 Years The Army and the Mint Empire money and a strange new echo in the age of Bitcoin Theres a pattern that keeps showing up in historyone of those deep structural rhythms that cuts across time technology and ideology. For most of human civilization when new money is createdwhether stamped metal or spreadsheet entriesit tends to follow the same basic structure 1. Money is minted 2. Soldiers are paid 3. Those soldiers circulate the money into societyby force or by presence I. The Ancient Pattern where money begins In Debt The First 5000 Years anthropologist David Graeber makes a compelling case that money didnt emerge from barter. It came from empire. Ancient states minted coins to pay armies. Those armies marched conquered land enslaved labor and extracted resources. The resources came home were melted down and turned into more coins. The cycle repeated. Coinage paid for war. War returned resources. The mint struck more coinage. The army didnt just defend the stateit distributed its money. It was the original mechanism of monetary circulation. You can see this in Lydia where stamped coinage first appeared Athens where silver from the Laurium mines paid hoplites Rome where legions were issued denarii and spread them across Europe and the Middle East Later colonial powers which demanded taxes payable only in imperial currency forcing participation in their money systems Graebers insight is that money was never just a market tool. It was a system of power and order always tethered to a states ability to project force. II. The American Machine debt war and the global dollar system The form changed. The pattern didnt. After WWII the United States assumed global hegemony. But instead of minting coins it issued debtTreasury bonds that functioned as the base layer of the modern monetary system. Nations bought our debt. We used the proceeds to fund Military bases in over 70 countries Proxy wars Vietnam Afghanistan Nicaragua Direct invasions Iraq Panama Libya Covert operations and surveillance programs run by a sprawling intelligence apparatus Debt became our coinage. The military remained the delivery mechanism. We absorbed goods from around the world and returned digital IOUs. Those IOUs were backed not by gold but by a system that included the worlds most powerful navy intelligence network and defense economy. As Jack Ma once said America spent 40 years absorbing the worlds valueand used it to fund wars. Austrian economists like Mises and Hayek warned that fiat money would distort incentives and lead to unchecked expansion. Modern Monetary Theorists embraced it. But either way the architecture stayed consistent Debt pays for force. Force protects the debt. It is elegant extractive and invisible to most people. And it still rests on the old triangle the mint the army the loop. III. Bitcoin and the Return of Cost a new architecture with an old shape And now we have Bitcoin. At first glance it looks like a clean break. Stateless. Borderless. Nonviolent. Just code. But look more closely and the structure reappears. Bitcoin also issues currencyon a fixed schedule. And like every monetary system before it that new money goes first to a specific group. Not to a king. Not to a central bank. To a set of actors we call miners. But miners isnt quite right. They arent digging. They arent finding. Theyre fighting. Miners are more accurately described as sentriesdefenders who burn real-world energy in a constant zero-sum battle for the right to write the next block of history. Every 10 minutes they Compete Consume power Validate time Prove cost And the winner is rewarded with freshly minted bitcoin. Every single bitcoin in existence was first paid to a sentry. There is no central issuance. No grants. No shortcuts. This echoes the ancient structure The money is minted through work It is issued first to the defenders It enters society through those defenders hands But theres a key difference No violence No conquest No ruler No territory Just rules energy and math Bitcoin is a monetary-military protocol. But instead of bullets it uses watts. Instead of conquest it uses cost. This resonates not just with history but with Austrian principles of sound money Scarce Costly to produce Incorruptible by decree And it aligns strangely with something older than economics the idea that legitimacy must be earnedthrough sacrifice not promise.

Instead of lawyers?","So a lot of people do have binge spending issues, shopping addictions, compulsive spending etc.. and lawyers charge a ridiculous amount / fees for this type of service (like a Trust, not sure what else) - been thinking.. 



I know nothing about smart contracts and what they’re capable of but I have been thinking of ways to set up something for when I die that could automate paying some people but monthly, to where no one can modify it. I guess technically I wouldn’t need a smart contract, just some servers that are unlikely to kill my vm’s. Automate with a timer sending crypto out monthly, pay the server company a lot ahead of time or just put enough funds in an account no one knows about to make sure it’ll keep running. But lots can go wrong, hacking, accidental bad updates or crashes etc.. have backups maybe, with code that runs after the main one was supposed to run to check if it is working and sending funds. 



Would there be a way to do this with crypto where I wouldn’t need to worry about having specific servers running?

2025-05-30T14:10:43.386774,2025-05-27T15:46:15,ethereum,1kwnoae,"FOCIL is proposed as the headliner for Ethereum’s next upgrade after Fusaka — Glamsterdam. 
What is it and why does it matter?","**1/5 What is FOCIL?**    
  
FOCIL stands for Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists, a new proposal EIP-7805 from Ethereum researcher soispoke.

It gives validators more power to ensure valid transactions get included in blocks, strengthening Ethereum’s censorship resistance.

  
**2/5** **Why shift power to validators?**  
  
Today, block builders decide which transactions make it into blocks.

With FOCIL, validators can enforce inclusion of valid transactions, making it harder for builders to exclude them. This rebalances power in Ethereum’s block production process.

  
**3/5 How users benefit?**  
  
FOCIL improves the user experience by enabling:

✅ Stronger censorship resistance.  
✅ Fairer inclusion of transactions.  
✅ Faster confirmations.  
✅ More trust in block production.

  
**4/5** **Where FOCIL stands today?**  
  
It’s already implemented by six Ethereum client teams, running on devnets, undergoing active testing, and open to community feedback.  
  
A proposal in progress, and a strong contender for Ethereum’s next major upgrade.



**5/5** **The heart of Glamsterdam**  
  
Every Ethereum upgrade has a defining feature.  
For Glamsterdam, the post-Fusaka fork, that spotlight now shines on FOCIL.  
  
By reinforcing credible neutrality and rebalancing power from centralized builders back to validators, FOCIL marks a turning point.  
  
It’s not just a technical improvement. It’s a statement of values.

I've passed the CFA lvl 1 exam, and have interned for 6 months in finance. Beyond that, my work has mainly been sales related. The business is going well, and I dropped out of a prestigious masters opportunity to start a new vertical / firm very soon. As I progress in my career, I have a keen interest to eventually turn my venture(s) partly passive, and find time for focused trading. 

I am patient, and can wait for many years before committing to trading. Given my current know how, age, and background, what path would you recommend?

I would love to receive any recommendations for resources - articles, books, courses, that I can make use of to smoothen my learning curve. I am also open to learning new skills, programming and more to incorporate if it is worth the time. Additionally, what is a realistic ROI that trading options can fetch me, if done right?

\- Spend 30-60min every night reviewing charts- Narrow down your watchlist to the best setups for the next day.

\- Determine your maximum acceptable loss per trade and set stop loss orders accordingly.

\- Quality over quantity. Focus on high probability setups rather than multiple trades. Be a sniper.  
  
\- Set price alerts on your phone so you know when a stock crosses your entry point. (perfect when working)

\- Try my best to trade the first 90 minutes of the day (This is typically when you see the most action)

\- DO NOT trade 0dte when first starting. Focus on swinging and high conviction trades.

\- Review and analyze your trades weekly to identify patterns in your successes and mistakes.  
  
Also, If you own shares of a stock already, you can try Covered Calls. Sell call options against them to earn premium income.

The initial tariff announcement typically drives the VIX up 15-25% within an hour, causing massive IV expansion across all strikes, particularly in near-dated options. Put options see delta acceleration due to increased gamma exposure near ATM strikes, while call premiums get crushed by both directional movement and vega exposure. The subsequent policy reversal creates the opposite effect: VIX compression, IV crush on puts, and explosive gamma-driven rallies that benefit call holders who survive the initial theta decay. This pattern creates specific technical opportunities for options traders.

1. Long volatility positions (straddles/strangles) benefit from the initial IV spike but must be closed before the reversal to avoid vega collapse. 

2. Short-dated puts experience extreme gamma risk during the announcement phase, as delta can move from 0.30 to 0.70+ within minutes on ATM strikes. 

3. The reversal phase often triggers massive gamma squeezes in calls as market makers hedge their short positions, creating explosive upside moves that far exceed what the underlying fundamentals would suggest. 

4. Theta decay accelerates during these high-IV periods, making timing more critical than directional accuracy.

My current strategy is  
I sell weekly CSP with around -0.2 delta on stocks that I find undervalued.  
I try to go for at least 4 different stocks in 4 different sectors.  
When assigned I sell CC with around 0.2 delta.  
This so far has been great to me, those DTE, at those deltas generate me an income that I'm comfortable with and since I believe the stocks to be undervalued I have no trouble with assignment.

My latest addition to my strategy is using margin or at least the buying power of it since I've been selling puts with deltas around -0.1, so far, those haven't been assigned. Of course their premium is much lower but I just consider it the sprinkle on top.

However, I've been thinking about making the following change:  
If right now 100% of my capital at around 0.2 delta generates an income I'm comfortable with could I sell puts considering both my capital + margin as a whole therefore being able to sell all those puts with an average lower delta, I would receive less premium per contract but sell twice the amount of contracts. In theory I should be able to generate the same income with a lower chance of assignment.

I’ve been experimenting with a semi-systematic trading framework,not fully automated, but with quant-based filtering to drive decision-making.

Each morning, I run a Python script that screens for:

Overnight range breaks

VWAP deviation thresholds

Volatility clusters (using ATR + historical beta)

Specific liquidity zone setups (based on custom levels, not order book)

Once the list is narrowed down, I manually monitor 5m/15m price action and only take trades if there's confirmation — usually after a second sweep or strong volume divergence.

I know this isn't 100% algo trading, but the quant side gives me a big edge in filtering noise, while the discretionary layer keeps me adaptive. I'm not scalping every tick, just high-probability setups that match the model's bias.

Curious if anyone else here is using hybrid workflows like this. How do you balance systematic signal generation with manual execution?

Not sure if this is too “discretionary” for this sub, but I figured someone here might be exploring something similar. Would be cool to exchange ideas with others doing hybrid workflows.And if anyone wants to know how I do it, please!

✓ Imports trades from TD, Tastyworks, IBKR (via CSV), Robinhood(via CSV)

✓ Tracks P&L by strategy (Iron Condors, CSPs, etc)

✓ Catches wash sales automatically

✓ Shows win rate by DTE

✓ Exports everything for taxes

If PFE takes off, I've missed out on some gains, but that's an opportunity cost, not quite the same as a loss.

Too many traders segregate puts and calls into separate bets, only to fumble when the market surprises them. Thankfully, you can use the Wheel strategy instead to harness time decay, volatility swings, and assignment mechanics in your favor.
In this article, we’re doing more than outlining “sell puts, then sell calls.” You’ll get a full, five-stage deep dive: the theory behind why it works, real-world examples of successes and failures, step-by-step drills to lock in each skill, and advanced pro-tips that most retail traders overlook. Let’s roll.

##Why The Wheel Strategy Outperforms Stand-Alone Strategies

The Wheel strategy is a logical extension of covered calls married to cash-secured puts. Rather than hoping for a one-directional move, you systematically “rent” your capital or shares to the market. First, you sell puts on a stock you’re comfortable owning; if assigned, you then sell calls to monetize holding the shares.

This rotation accomplishes two goals: you generate immediate income through time decay and implied volatility, and you avoid speculative directional risk by defining both entry (via puts) and exit (via calls) points in advance. Studies of covered-call indexes (like the BXM) show they tend to outperform buy-and-hold over decades in total return metrics, largely because they harvest option premium consistently. The Wheel simply adds the put-selling leg to capture premium even when you aren’t long shares yet.

Consider a long-only call strategy: you pay a debit and face total time decay—your position can bleed to zero if you’re even one day late. A naked put sells premium to your buyer, but carries the risk of assignment if the stock gaps down. The Wheel blends them: premium buffers both directions, assignment always recoils back into another income leg, and your only true risk is carrying shares well below your discounted cost basis.

##Identify Ideal Market Regimes and Stock Characteristics

Not every environment or equity makes a good Wheel candidate. The optimal scenario combines moderate implied volatility (IV rank between 30–60%), a relatively stable price channel, and robust options liquidity. When IV is too low, premiums won’t justify the risk; when IV is too high, the market is signaling potential for violent moves that can blow out leveraged positions.

Range-bound markets are gold mines for the Wheel. You repeatedly sell puts near support and calls near resistance, harvesting premium each time price reverts. Historical backtests on range-bound stocks like large-cap consumer staples (e.g., KO, PG) or tech giants post-earnings (e.g., AAPL after major product cycles) show premium capture on both legs can exceed 12% annualized returns, even before dividends.

Crucially, you should exclude stocks with binary event risks. Stocks with week-to-week IV rank above 70% often trade in panic mode—assignment risk spikes, and rolling becomes expensive. Instead, focus on large-cap names with daily option volume north of 1,000 contracts across relevant strikes and expirations.

Deep-dive drill: Build a watchlist of 10 stocks. For each, note the current IV rank, 52-week trading range, and average daily option volume. Eliminate any that fail two of those three criteria.

##Preparation: Platform Setup, Cash Management, and Journal Templates

Before your first Wheel rotation, lay the groundwork. Choose a brokerage that offers advanced options analytics—think real-time Greeks, custom chain filters, and reliable exercise/assignment notifications. Interactive Brokers, ThinkOrSwim, and Tastyworks all rank highly for pro-level tools and low commissions.

Next, manage your cash: since you’re selling cash-secured puts, you must reserve 100 × strike price per contract in available buying power. Treat that reserve as off-limits for stock purchases or other trades. This discipline prevents margin calls when assignments happen. If you run multiple concurrent Wheels, tally your total put obligations in a spreadsheet tab labeled “Put Reserves.”

Finally, create a rolling journal template. At minimum, each trade entry should capture: underlying, leg (put or call), strike, expiration, premium received, max loss, breakeven, and assignment date. Overlay a section where you log actual P/L and notes on execution quality or market surprises. Reviewing this journal monthly will spotlight which underlyings and strike/expiration combos yield the smoothest cycles.

Use a simple Google Sheet with data validation drop-downs for underlyings and strategy legs. Add conditional formatting to flag any max-loss >1.5% of account equity.

##Balance Theta Decay, Delta Probability, and IV Skew

a. Put leg strikes & expirations:
- Expiration: 30–45 days out. This DTE window offers optimal annualized theta decay (~3–4% daily on premium) while keeping rolling costs manageable if you need to extend. Weeklies burn too quickly; LEAPS tie up capital for months.
- Strike: 0.20–0.30 delta. That corresponds to a 70–80% probability of expiring worthless, balancing income with assignment likelihood.

b. Call leg strikes & expirations:
- Expiration: Mirror your put cycle or choose the next monthly expiration, whichever aligns best with your tax and capital plans.
- Strike: 0.30–0.40 delta. Higher delta calls yield more premium but increase the chance of early assignment; lower deltas pay less but may never get exercised.


##Precision Execution, Rolling Rules, and Assignment Management

Execution quality matters. Always use limit orders to capture your target premium. If the bid stays static for 15 minutes, consider improving your price by 1–2 cents to tee up a quicker fill.

Rolling rules: When a put is down 50% of its original premium with >7 days to expiry, rolling can lock profits and restart the cycle. For calls, if your call leg reaches 75% of max profit, buy to close and re-sell a new call further OTM or later DTE. These thresholds aren’t arbitrary—they come from optimizing the expected value of auto-roll backtests across hundreds of historical cycles.

Upon put assignment, immediately sell your calls at or near the bid to capture fresh premium. If you miss the first day, you leave tens or hundreds of dollars on the table. Conversely, if a call is about to be assigned and you want to continue owning, buy back the call and roll to the next cycle rather than forfeiting shares.

**Tactical checklist:**

1. Pre-market: scan open puts at 2% away from your strikes.

2. Mid-day: if filled, set alerts for your new covered call leg.

3. Close: review any fills and log execution quality in your journal.

By layering these five deep dives—strategy rationale, market selection, preparation, strike/expiration science, and disciplined trade management—you turn the Wheel strategy from a casual idea into a systematic income machine.

This isn’t vaporware or a stealth fork of something else. It’s a live DeFi infrastructure update — and possibly a preview of where this industry is headed.

# What Is Maneki?

Maneki is an **AI agent built to make DeFi accessible, transparent, and safer**, especially for newer users navigating yield strategies across multiple chains.

She’s designed to:

* **Analyze user portfolios** across 9 chains in real time
* **Recommend yield opportunities** based on personalized goals and risk levels
* **Auto-generate transactions** for bridging, swapping, and depositing
* Provide **live portfolio updates** and PnL breakdowns
* Offer **DeFi education and guided onboarding** for newcomers

Maneki is deeply integrated into [Rivo](https://app.rivo.xyz/maneki), a platform offering 60+ non-custodial yield strategies across ETH, BTC, stablecoins, and altcoins.

# $MANEKI Token Is Live

* **Contract (Base):** `0xe6ab1Cc1307b496748753E017f3dBB4D4378Ca3f`
* Available now on **Uniswap (Base)**
* Originally launched through the **Virtuals Genesis** presale platform

Unlike typical tokens launched with no purpose beyond speculation, $MANEKI is already woven into Rivo’s utility stack:

* Unlocks **premium AI tools and lower platform fees**
* Enables **governance participation** for integrating new yield strategies
* Boosts **Rivo Points Program** rewards for active users
* Receives benefit from **platform-generated buybacks and LP provisioning**

# OG Premium Access

Users who **hold or stake 50,000 $MANEKI** receive:

* Unlimited use of Maneki’s AI tools
* Lower transaction fees (0.2%)
* Real-time portfolio alerts and advanced tracking
* Priority support from Rivo’s DeFi experts
* Access to future AI agents in development

This isn’t future-facing only — the benefits are active now for users engaging with the ecosystem.

# Why This Matters for DeFi

AI and DeFi are intersecting more meaningfully in 2025, and Rivo appears to be one of the first to ship something functional. Maneki’s approach aligns with:

* Non-custodial finance: all DeFi interactions go direct to protocol
* Transparent yield education: helping users understand risk/reward
* Cross-chain complexity reduction: Maneki handles the heavy lifting
* Real user incentives: Points Program + token-based boosts

As protocols increasingly build around **user experience, safety, and automation**, platforms like Rivo—and AI agents like Maneki—could mark a shift toward truly intuitive DeFi engagement.

# TL;DR

* Maneki (AI DeFi agent) is now live inside the Rivo app
* $MANEKI token is live on Uniswap (Base), with utility from day one
* Features include live portfolio analysis, yield strategy recommendations, and risk profiling
* Token unlocks premium access, boosts, and governance
* The Rivo ecosystem is expanding and positioning itself at the intersection of AI and passive DeFi

For users frustrated by the fragmentation and manual work of DeFi, this could be a signal of what’s next: personalized, safe, AI-powered autonomy in a cross-chain world.

Stock futures fell Friday morning after President Donald Trump said China violated its preliminary trade agreement, reigniting fears that the U.S. could enter a global trade war.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average
lost 174 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures

each slid 0.6%.

Futures took a leg down on Friday morning after Trump claimed in a social media post that China “violated” its current trade agreement with the U.S. That comes after Treasury Secretary Bessent said in a Fox News interview that U.S.-China trade talks “are a bit stalled.”

These comments come as the administration has found its contentious plan for broad and steep levies in legal limbo. Investors are now wondering if, or when, a long-term agreement between China and the U.S. can be reached.

Legal concerns hit a boiling point after the Court of International Trade on Wednesday night halted the majority of Trump’s tariffs. But an appeals court granted a stay on Thursday afternoon, allowing the duties to remain in place until next week.

The Trump administration is now considering using a provision of the Trade Act of 1974 to implement tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days, according to The Wall Street Journal.

This news is the latest dose of uncertainty for what was an already uneasy market. Investors have contended with macroeconomic concerns tied to tariffs and worry that the shakeup to U.S. trade policy could cause a recession.

Yet stocks are on the verge of closing out May with strong gains following a rocky April. The S&P 500 has added more than 6% this month, while the Nasdaq Composite has surged 10% in that time. The 30-stock Dow has gained about 4% on the month.

“I think as we head into summer that momentum can continue, [but] then that’s where the hard data that may catch up to the weaker, soft data, could come into play,” Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist Ed Clissold told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday. “I think as we move through the second quarter into the third quarter, there’s still some good momentum in the market.”

For the week, the S&P 500 has advanced about 2%, while the 30-stock Dow is up 1.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has advanced 2.3%.

Investors will also monitor a fresh reading of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, on Friday.

President Donald Trump lashed out at China on Friday morning on Truth Social, saying China had ""violated"" its trade deal with the US.

""China was in big trouble two weeks ago"" due to the high tariffs set by the US, he said. Trump said he made a quick deal with China — which he accused them of breaking.

""The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" Trump wrote.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that trade talks between the US and China are ""a bit stalled,"" saying a call between President Trump and China's Xi Jinping may be needed

The escalation comes as the US-China detente — reached earlier this month, when each country eased sky-high tariffs on the other — looks more fragile amid both trade-related and other tensions.

Meanwhile, Trump's most sweeping tariffs have entered a period of legal uncertainty. A federal appeals court allowed the tariffs to temporarily stay in effect, a day after the US Court of International Trade blocked their implementation, deeming the method used to enact them ""unlawful.""

That means Trump's tariff agenda remains intact, if in flux, in the latest twist in the unfolding legal saga.

Late Wednesday, the trade court voted to block many of Trump's tariffs, including the flat-rate ""reciprocal"" tariffs aimed at US trade partners, as well as key China-focused duties.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which oversees the International Trade Court, granted the Trump administration’s request for a temporary administrative stay. This gives the court time to review legal arguments and filings. The administration must submit its briefings by June 9, after which the court will determine the next steps.

The White House had vowed Thursday to take its appeal to the Supreme Court if necessary.

Administration officials also hinted that court rulings would not be the final say for a president who has based much of his economic agenda on enacting the tariffs. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has an overview of the other maneuvers Trump could pursue.

Amid the legal chaos, US trade negotiations have apparently continued in earnest this week with India and the EU.",No paywall President Donald Trump lashed out at China on Friday morning on Truth Social saying China had violated its trade deal with the US. China was in big trouble two weeks ago due to the high tariffs set by the US he said. Trump said he made a quick deal with China which he accused them of breaking. The bad news is that China perhaps not surprisingly to some HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY Trump wrote. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that trade talks between the US and China are a bit stalled saying a call between President Trump and Chinas Xi Jinping may be needed The escalation comes as the US-China detente reached earlier this month when each country eased sky-high tariffs on the other looks more fragile amid both trade-related and other tensions. Meanwhile Trumps most sweeping tariffs have entered a period of legal uncertainty. A federal appeals court allowed the tariffs to temporarily stay in effect a day after the US Court of International Trade blocked their implementation deeming the method used to enact them unlawful. That means Trumps tariff agenda remains intact if in flux in the latest twist in the unfolding legal saga. Late Wednesday the trade court voted to block many of Trumps tariffs including the flat-rate reciprocal tariffs aimed at US trade partners as well as key China-focused duties. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which oversees the International Trade Court granted the Trump administrations request for a temporary administrative stay. This gives the court time to review legal arguments and filings. The administration must submit its briefings by June 9 after which the court will determine the next steps.

It’s still early, but I’m looking for:
	•	Traders who’d like to test the app for free
	•	Honest feedback on what features matter to you
	•	Maybe even people with a TikTok or IG audience who might want to share it — in exchange I’d be happy to give you lifetime premium access

It is the largest and most active financial market in the world, running 24 hours a day, five days a week. 

In this blog, we will take a simple journey through what the forex market is, the history of foreign currency exchange, how it works today, and what are its pros and cons. Whether you’re a beginner or just curious, this guide will help you understand the exciting world of foreign currency exchange trading in a very easy way.

# What is Forex Market Meaning?

The Forex market, also known as forex or FX, is a global place where people and businesses trade different currencies. It works all around the world, 24 hours a day, without any physical location like a stock market. This market helps set the value of one currency against another, for example, how many Indian Rupees you get for 1 US Dollar.

In simple words, it’s a big system where money is exchanged between countries. People use this market to buy, sell, convert, or guess the future value of currencies. For example, someone may buy US dollars today and sell them later at a higher price to make profit.

**Many different groups use the forex market, like:**

* Banks
* Big companies
* Central banks (like the Reserve Bank of India)
* Investment firms
* Hedge funds
* Retail traders (regular people)

This market is also very important for businesses that trade goods with other countries. It helps them change their money into the right currency for buying and selling internationally.

Also, forex always works in pairs. For example, USD/INR means the exchange between US Dollar and Indian Rupee is Forex currency pairs exchange. If the rate is 1 USD = 83 INR, this means one US Dollar equals eighty-three Indian Rupees. The market decides this rate based on demand and supply.

The history of foreign currency exchange is very exciting. Every day, trillions of dollars are traded here. It also supports the smooth working of other markets by keeping money flowing easily.

# What is Forex Market Types?

* Option Market

# What is Forex Market Features?

**Open 24 Hours a Day**: One of the most special things about the forex market is that it is open 24 hours a day, from Monday to Friday. It moves across different time zones, starting from markets in Asia, then Europe, and finally the USA. 

**Decides Exchange Rates:** Our foreign exchange trading in the UAE market helps in deciding the exchange rates of different currencies. The rate shows how foreign exchange currency pairs are worth in terms of another, for example, how many Indian Rupees are needed to buy 1 US Dollar. 

**Helps in Currency Conversion:** This market also helps with currency conversion, which means turning one currency into another. This is very important for international trade and travel. For example, if an Indian company needs to pay a supplier in Japan, it has to convert rupees into Japanese yen. The foreign exchange market makes this process smooth and fast.

I traded using a quantitative scalping model, focusing on short-term momentum bursts and VWAP returns. Most of the wins came from low volume retracements on trend continuation setups, especially between 9:40-10:30 AM EST. I avoided chopping zones and only went long when my model showed a high probability move supported by L2 speed and spread compression. One mistake I'm working on is overtrading low R settings after 11am. The best day was a $4.9k profit on just 3 trades - all trend continuation trades on an unusually clean day.

2025-05-31T11:53:26.799210,2025-05-30T20:21:01,trading,1kzbhda,Why Selling Options Premium Often Outperforms Buying It,"Most traders start by buying options — calls, puts, etc and that is a good place to start to understand options mechanics. But if you’re a newer trader you probably spend time hoping for a breakout. And while that can work occasionally, it’s a tough game stacked against you.

Here’s why:

When you buy an option, especially out-of-the-money, you’re often working with a 20–30% probability of profit. That means you’re wrong more than 70% of the time, even if your directional idea is right. Why? Because of time decay (theta) and volatility crush (IV drop after events like earnings).

Now compare that to selling premium — especially in high-IV environments:

• You’re the one collecting the premium
• You profit as time passes, even if the stock goes nowhere
• Your break-even is wider than a simple call or put
• You’re often working with 60%–85%+ probability of profit depending on the strategy

It’s not about predicting direction. It’s about trading with statistics and edge, letting the law of large numbers play out over time. That’s why professional traders, hedge funds, and market makers are usually on the selling side — because they know options decay, and they’re happy to be paid for that.

And contrary to what many think, selling premium doesn’t have to be boring.

There are plenty of same-day (0DTE) vertical spread setups with well-structured risk/reward and high win rates. You can still express directional opinions — just with a defined edge instead of relying on hope and timing.

Selling defined-risk spreads (like verticals or iron condors) allows you to:

✅ Keep risk controlled

✅ Maximize theta decay

✅ Let implied volatility contraction work for you, not against you

✅ Build consistent income with high-probability trades

Is selling premium a magic bullet? No. But it shifts the odds in your favor — and in trading, that’s everything.

If you’re tired of watching your long calls decay to zero… maybe it’s time to try the other side. The math is on your side.",Most traders start by buying options calls puts etc and that is a good place to start to understand options mechanics. But if youre a newer trader you probably spend time hoping for a breakout. And while that can work occasionally its a tough game stacked against you. Heres why When you buy an option especially out-of-the-money youre often working with a 2030% probability of profit. That means youre wrong more than 70% of the time even if your directional idea is right. Why Because of time decay theta and volatility crush IV drop after events like earnings. Now compare that to selling premium especially in high-IV environments Youre the one collecting the premium You profit as time passes even if the stock goes nowhere Your break-even is wider than a simple call or put Youre often working with 60%85%+ probability of profit depending on the strategy Its not about predicting direction. Its about trading with statistics and edge letting the law of large numbers play out over time. Thats why professional traders hedge funds and market makers are usually on the selling side because they know options decay and theyre happy to be paid for that. And contrary to what many think selling premium doesnt have to be boring. There are plenty of same-day 0DTE vertical spread setups with well-structured riskreward and high win rates. You can still express directional opinions just with a defined edge instead of relying on hope and timing. Selling defined-risk spreads like verticals or iron condors allows you to Keep risk controlled Maximize theta decay Let implied volatility contraction work for you not against you Build consistent income with high-probability trades Is selling premium a magic bullet No. But it shifts the odds in your favor and in trading thats everything. If youre tired of watching your long calls decay to zero maybe its time to try the other side. The math is on your side.,trader start buying option call put etc good place start understand option mechanic youre newer trader probably spend time hoping breakout work occasionally tough game stacked Heres buy option especially out-of-the-money youre often working 2030 probability profit mean youre wrong 70 time even directional idea right time decay theta volatility crush IV drop event like earnings compare selling premium especially high-IV environment Youre one collecting premium profit time pass even stock go nowhere break-even wider simple call put Youre often working 60 85 probability profit depending strategy predicting direction trading statistic edge letting law large number play time Thats professional trader hedge fund market maker usually selling side know option decay theyre happy paid contrary many think selling premium doesnt boring plenty same-day 0DTE vertical spread setup well-structured riskreward high win rate still express directional opinion defined edge instead relying hope timing Selling defined-risk spread like vertical iron condor allows Keep risk controlled Maximize theta decay Let implied volatility contraction work Build consistent income high-probability trade selling premium magic bullet shift odds favor trading thats everything youre tired watching long call decay zero maybe time try side math side,"GS,KO",6,3,https://reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kzbhda/why_selling_options_premium_often_outperforms/,TradeVue

Officials are drafting a rule that would impose US government licensing requirements on transactions with companies that are majority-owned by already-sanctioned firms, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some of China’s biggest semiconductor design and fabrication firms are subject to US sanctions via the so-called Entity List, from Huawei Technologies Co. to Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., as part of a far-reaching US campaign to rein in a geopolitical rival’s technological ascent. The goal of the new policy is to prevent workarounds to the curbs via the creation of new subsidiaries — a trend that’s produced what some US policymakers describe as a whack-a-mole problem.

The White House and Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The move risks deepening tensions between the world’s two largest economies, especially after President Donald Trump accused China on Friday of violating the spirit of recent negotiations in Geneva. Export controls imposed by Washington to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors have angered Chinese officials, while a crackdown by Beijing on exports of critical minerals has sparked outrage among Trump officials.

The subsidiary rule — which applies a 50% ownership threshold in relation to companies on the Entity List, Military End-User list and Specially Designated Nationals list — could be unveiled as soon as June, said the people, who asked not to be named to discuss private deliberations. The people emphasized that the contents and timing of the rule and related sanctions are not yet finalized and could still change. After the rule is published, the US is likely to move forward with new sanctions on major Chinese companies, the people said.

Hello.

My name is Obada. I'm from a 3rd world Arab country (Jordan) and I'm 25. I want to explain something very important to everyone who is struggling in this game.

So, lets say you trade with a reputable broker such as IC Markets. This broker passes all your trades to the liquidity provider, which is the bank they deal with. Most traders use TP and SL, therefore giving the big boys an advantage to see your setups. I know you'll say that your 0.01 is pointless, but there are hundreds of thousands of trades every single day. If you ever noticed being wicked then seeing the chart move in your direction, do not be surprised, because they need your money (at least the majority) to stay in the game. The solution is definitely not having an SL, but widening it to the point where its very hard to hit, outside liquidity zones. 

So guys, don't underestimate a wide SL. Pick a spot where its hard for these scammers to reach.

Personally, I trade gold and a 200 pip SL works like a charm. I'd like to hear your thoughts.

Driven by: US-China tariff truce, cooling inflation (PCE 2.1 %), expectations of Fed cuts, and a mega-tech rebound.

Still very concentrated: the Magnificent 7 account for ≈40 % of the return.

Forward P/E ~22× (10-yr avg ≈18×). Little room for error if macro or earnings disappoint.

Risks: tariff fight could reignite, hot jobs/CPI data may delay the Fed, weak market breadth (<55 % above 50-day SMA).

Levels to watch: 5,970-6,000 (resistance), 5,760 (50-day SMA), 5,550 (key support).

Healthy or Concentrated?

Super-concentration: Mag-7 weighting >30 %. Nvidia/Apple pullbacks = volatility spikes.

Green shoots: Flows into industrials, staples, banks—still faint.

Rich valuation: Forward P/E 22× vs 18× average.

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation, dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which introduces a new Section 899 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This proposed section aims to ""weaponize"" taxes on foreign investors by significantly increasing tax rates for certain non-U.S. individuals and businesses.

**Key aspects of Section 899:**

* **Purpose:** It is intended as a diplomatic tool to counter what the U.S. considers ""unfair foreign taxes"" imposed by other countries on U.S. businesses and individuals. These ""unfair foreign taxes"" include undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), and diverted profits taxes (DPTs).
* **Mechanism:** The legislation would apply increased U.S. federal income tax rates—ranging from 5% to 20% incrementally—on certain income earned by non-U.S. persons from ""discriminatory foreign countries."" A ""discriminatory foreign country"" is defined as any non-U.S. jurisdiction that imposes one or more of these ""unfair foreign taxes.""
* **Affected Parties:** The heightened tax rates would apply to a broad category of foreign persons, including foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, individuals, corporations, private foundations, trusts, and partnerships associated with these designated countries.
* **Impact:** If enacted, Section 899 could introduce substantial economic and compliance challenges for foreign governments, multinational enterprises, and investors. Experts suggest it could lead to the ""weaponization of U.S. capital markets"" and potentially weaken the dollar and impact European stocks with U.S. exposure.
* **Current Status:** The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration, where significant changes are still anticipated",The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act which introduces a new Section 899 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

Legit or Scam?,"I recently came across Ashton Gray Developers that claims to offer high-yield returns on real estate investments. According to them, they provide returns significantly higher than what we typically see with most other investment options.

When I rang them to inquire, I was told that the minimum investment required is $50,000 for 22% p.a. simple interest.

From what I’ve gathered, many of the people involved appear to be Indian, and most of their projects are based in Texas.

Has anyone here had any experience with them? Or can anyone help verify whether this is a legitimate opportunity or a potential scam?

Any insights or due diligence tips would be greatly appreciated!

My spouse is about to graduate medical school with nearly $300K of student loans. I cashed out all of my stock portfolio and paid off $176K of that, leaving $101K to go. 

My question is: Should I cash out my Roth (Currently $68K) to help pay off further loans, blow all leftover income from future paychecks (about $3K a month), or invest more in the market and make minimum payments on the student loans moving forward? Loans are officially going to enter repayment mode this November, but are gathering interest anyway since they are Grad Plus and Unsubsidized government loans.

I have no other debt other than a mortgage at 3.125% so I am making just the minimum monthly payment on that.

Remaining student loans and their interest rates:

Loan 1: $22,600; 6.08%

Loan 2: $22,325; 5.28%

Loan 3: $22.760; 6.54%

2025-05-31T11:53:26.799210,2025-05-30T21:44:11,investing,1kzdhya,Do Acc ETFs lose underlying assets over time due to the expense ratio? Is this a long-term concern?,"From what I understand, the underlying assets of an Acc ETF (but not necessarily its value) decrease slightly over time. Each year, the fund manager takes a percentage of the fund’s value as a fee — the expense ratio.

I get that the value of the Acc ETF can still grow if it tracks a profitable index (like the S&P 500). But even though the value increases, the quantity of underlying assets (i.e., the number of shares the ETF holds) should decrease a little each year, since the manager needs to sell some assets to cover the fee.

In the short and medium term, this probably isn’t a big deal. But in the very long run, could this be a problem?

If the Acc ETF keeps selling small portions of the basket each year, will the asset quantity eventually shrink too much? Or is this just a technical detail that doesn’t matter in practice?

Should I be worried about this over a time frame of, say, many decades?

Thanks!

This is a post that rationally discusses the prospects of Tesla and the huge bubble in the US stock market. I know that my native language is Chinese. Many posts before this have been criticized for their poor English, so I used GPT to translate it into English, but the content is all written by me. I hope the administrator will not delete it.



**Once upon a bull market, Tesla wasn't just a car company. It was a religion. A meme. A movement. A narrative so powerful it defied gravity, valuation models, and even quarterly earnings. But now? It looks more like a slow-motion collapse wrapped in AI promises and tweet-sized miracles.**

Tesla's market cap—still hovering near **$580 billion**—dwarfs the combined value of multiple legacy automakers that, together, sell tens of millions more vehicles annually. Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, Stellantis, GM, Ford, Honda, Hyundai... all still trail behind. Tesla, meanwhile, **sells fewer cars**, has **no new models in sight**, and faces a **50% drop in European sales**.

What’s driving that valuation? Not cars. Not earnings. Not delivery growth. Just **narratives**.

**Narrative #1: FSD will change the world.**  
It hasn’t. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving remains a **Level 2 driver assist system**—miles away from full autonomy. Elon’s promises of robotaxis “next year” date back to 2016. Today, regulatory hurdles and technical stagnation have turned this dream into a meme.

**Narrative #2: Tesla is an AI company.**  
Sure—if you consider YouTube clips of “optimus” robots doing carefully choreographed tasks a viable roadmap. The humanoid robot narrative is pure sci-fi, built for headlines and hopium.

**Narrative #3: Clean energy saviour.**  
Tesla earns billions not from products, but from **regulatory carbon credits**—money that vanishes as competitors go electric. Even subsidies are drying up in markets like Germany and the U.S.

So what’s left? **Bitcoin gains.** Elon’s real alpha play may just be Doge-fueled attention arbitrage.

**But here’s the real danger:**  
Tesla isn’t just a company—it’s become **too big to ignore**, and perhaps **too public to fail quietly**. Global pension funds, ESG portfolios, sovereign wealth managers, and speculative capital fueled by zero-interest rates are all in deep. Behind every retail trader shouting “diamond hands” is a sleepy institutional allocator praying this doesn’t blow up before retirement.

If Tesla collapses, it won’t be Enron—a cooked-book scandal.  
It won’t be Lehman—a financial black hole.  
It will be **both**:

* The faith-based valuation of Enron
* The systemic exposure of Lehman

A bursting Tesla bubble could trigger **liquidity shocks**, **portfolio meltdowns**, and a **narrative crash** that destroys trust in market rationality.

**Narrative capitalism brought us here.**  
A reality show CEO. A meme-powered valuation. A fanbase more loyal than customers. We’ve built a castle of perception with no foundation of delivery.

And when castles fall, they don’t just crumble.

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation, dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which introduces a new Section 899 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This proposed section aims to ""weaponize"" taxes on foreign investors by significantly increasing tax rates for certain non-U.S. individuals and businesses.

**Key aspects of Section 899:**

* **Purpose:** It is intended as a diplomatic tool to counter what the U.S. considers ""unfair foreign taxes"" imposed by other countries on U.S. businesses and individuals. These ""unfair foreign taxes"" include undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), and diverted profits taxes (DPTs).
* **Mechanism:** The legislation would apply increased U.S. federal income tax rates—ranging from 5% to 20% incrementally—on certain income earned by non-U.S. persons from ""discriminatory foreign countries."" A ""discriminatory foreign country"" is defined as any non-U.S. jurisdiction that imposes one or more of these ""unfair foreign taxes.""
* **Affected Parties:** The heightened tax rates would apply to a broad category of foreign persons, including foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, individuals, corporations, private foundations, trusts, and partnerships associated with these designated countries.
* **Impact:** If enacted, Section 899 could introduce substantial economic and compliance challenges for foreign governments, multinational enterprises, and investors. Experts suggest it could lead to the ""weaponization of U.S. capital markets"" and potentially weaken the dollar and impact European stocks with U.S. exposure.
* **Current Status:** The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration, where significant changes are still anticipated

Major averages, including the S&P 500, faced a downturn on Friday, falling 1% in response to reports of the US planning to expand technology sanctions against China. The proposed measures aim to target subsidiaries of Chinese companies currently under US restrictions, signaling an escalation in the ongoing tensions between the two economic powerhouses.

The sell-off in the markets was primarily driven by news from Bloomberg indicating that the Trump administration is considering new regulations that would require US government licensing for transactions with entities that are majority-owned by firms already on the US sanctions list. This move is intended to close loopholes that have allowed Chinese companies to circumvent existing sanctions by establishing new subsidiaries.

The potential for increased regulatory scrutiny and sanctions has raised concerns about the impact on global tech and semiconductor industries, which are deeply interconnected with Chinese firms. Some of China’s largest tech entities, such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., are already facing restrictions under the US Entity List, and the new policy would further tighten these controls.

While the White House and Commerce Department have not yet commented on the matter, the proposed subsidiary rule could be announced as early as June. The rule would apply a 50% ownership threshold in relation to companies on the Entity List, Military End-User list, and Specially Designated Nationals list. However, details and timing are subject to change as the policy and related sanctions are not finalized.

The market’s negative reaction reflects investor apprehension about the broader implications of heightened US-China tech tensions. The ongoing dispute has previously resulted in supply chain disruptions and has the potential to affect a wide range of industries reliant on technology and semiconductors.",No paywall Major averages including the SP 500 faced a downturn on Friday falling 1% in response to reports of the US planning to expand technology sanctions against China.

* **Optimal expiration periods**
* **Strike price selection**
* **Managing assignments**
* Any **specific experiences with GOOG or HOOD**

**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the short term:**

UNH Dividend Raise: 

2022 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/06** 

2022 Dividend raised from $1.45 to $1.65: **06/08** 

2023 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/05** 

2023 Dividend raised from $1.65 to $1.88: **06/07** 

2024 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/03** 

2024 Dividend raised from $1.88 to $2.10: **06/05** 

The 2025 annual shareholder meeting: scheduled for **06/02** Which means, the dividend level will be announced on Wednesday **06/04**. This will send the stock soaring or crashing. Let’s be real though, the insiders wouldn’t have spent millions of their own money on shares at $288, if they knew they were slashing the dividend level. 06/04. They would have waited until after that announcement to buy. This is common sense, there is no other reason in the world that the insiders would have bought with their own money, besides they think the stock is going up, and at the time they bought, they know where the dividend level is headed on Wednesday. 

For reference, here is a listing of the recent insider purchases (yes this is from ChatGPT. Cry.)

* **Stephen Hemsley (CEO)**
   * Shares Purchased: 86,700
   * Average Price: $288.57
   * Total Purchase: \~$25 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **John Rex (President & CFO)**
   * Total Purchase: \~$5 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **Board Directors (3 directors)**
   * Purchases: N/A details
   * Date: May 2025

  
**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the long term:**   
Blue chip stock. Will appeal/settle with the DOJ. Will provide guidance when its clear if pharma tariffs are sticking. It's too big to fail (like Enron/Lehman Brothers),

**TLDR;** The Dividend level will be raised this Wednesday, which will encourage faith in the company, and start the recovery of the share price.

But some do - And i'd like to share the process of how i select which one's to use 

When i first started testing parameters i was completely lost , i wanted to test the ADX on my strategy what is the pNL on different ranges of the ADX and can i use the ADX to switch on and off the strategy 

The problem was there are so many time frames and so many look back periods   
I was at point where i have 50 backtests of 4 years each of different crypto coins on which i had to test at-least 5 time frames of ADX with like 3 different look back periods.   
50x4x5x3 = R.I.P  
My laptop and brain would get FRIED even thinking about this 

And over that i'd worry about overfitting and how to choose the right one. 

The ADX parameter later failed after lot of testing but i learnt some stuff   
By which i choose parameters in a much more efficient way for myself 

Since most of us just have one laptop and can't really run hardcore tests and optimize parameters.   
What i do is eyeball stuff. Just using my market knowledge

And how i see if parameters are right for my strategy or chuck them out is this :   
  
1. You form a base hypothesis of which parameter might work or why - can be done by looking a long periods of outperformance / underperformance/ flatlined on the equity curve   
OR studying the winners and losers from your backtest seeing what's common in them, write these points down  
  
2. If the parameter you choose is highly inconsistent throughout the backtest , i check 2-3 versions with varying TF and length and if the results are shit u throw them out  
  
3. If the parameter show's promise over the whole course of the backtest over different windows as mentioned in point 2 and ( is fractal )  
So suppose we're using a parameter of time frames 2H , 4H and 8H   
if over the whole course of the backtest each of the time frames has got similarities  then i arrive at a conclusion yeah something might be worth exploring here   
  
Another way i eyeball parameters windows to test is i check the average trade duration if my trades last for 12h in average in example and use's price data of only last few days suppose one week   
I test the parameters around that price data ( 3 days - 14 days )   
  
4. You walk forward with the parameters : suppose i've chosen a parameter which i right for my backtest and my in sample data is from 2000 to 2010 

4.1 : If one parameter shows significant results in all year's i just use them for my out of sample as well   
Suppose the parameter did good 8/10 years and is remaining fractal for all of those then i just run them with out of sample 

4.2 I use a rolling window , we test the results in 10 years , then we go from 2001 to 2011 and so on   
and i put a threshold on the parameter that its success rate has to be 7/10 years or so always 

If all the boxes tick and most importantly if i FEEL its right for my strategy i deploy them. 

  
This is how i do it 

I'd like to know how u all do it , or how i could make my approach better.

I'll go first !,"Hey algo trading friends, I've listened to and read dozens (or more) trading books over the last couple years, and I wanted to share some of my favorites and get your recommendations for continued reading (and listening). 

Even though I algo trade only crypto (and only very part time when life allows me to work on it), I've learned a ton from these books. I'm not going to give specifics about why I liked EVERY single book, particularly because some of them I read over two years ago and don't remember all the details. I just know I rated all of these highly and got something of value from them. 

1) The whole Market Wizards series by Jack Schwager, particularly Hedge Fund Market Wizards (but they've all got tons of gems). I know these are some of the most ubiquitous books on trading but still wanted to mention them for anyone who hasn't read them. A gold mine of insights, inspiration, and cautionary tales  from master traders. 

2) High Probability Trading by Marcel Link. This book will be particularly helpful to noobies trying to formulate strategies, but it's just a great refresher and primer on dozens of different trading ideas, best practices, and strategies regardless. You may just nod along and go ""yup"" but  I really like the way he lays it all out and feel it's an excellent resource. 

3) the All Weather Trade by Tom Basso. It's just hard not to like this guy, and he gives some good, if fairly simplistic, information about his trend following and diversification strategies. I first heard of him through Market Wizards of course. 

4) The Complete Turtle Trader by Michael Covel. Whether you learn anything of significant substance from this book is up in the air, but as someone  running primarily trend following strats I found it reaffirming, and it's a pretty good story. 

5) Not a book, but I've gotten a lot of value from the Better System Trader podcast. Sadly I think they're no longer producing new episodes (most recent is August '24) but it's an invaluable resource. 

I could list many more, and I know some of these are very general and rudimentary, but as someone coming from a purely programming background with no trading experience they've been incredibly informative. 

I'd love to hear suggestions from you guys. . Particularly dealing with systematic and algorithmic trading obviously but also general market / trading strategy books. I like hearing stories from ultra successful traders (a la Market Wizards) but open to all of it, from high level math and algo stuff I won't fully comprehend to memoires. What are your favorites?

Ps: yes, I also have a soft spot for Reminiscences of a Stock Operator... I've read it twice, it's required reading for all degens IMHO 😁 ",Hey algo trading friends Ive listened to and read dozens or more trading books over the last couple years and I wanted to share some of my favorites and get your recommendations for continued reading and listening.

Sample sizes are small so take with a grain of salt but this was confusing as i'd expect trend following to do better on high gamma volatile days and mean reversion better on low gamma calmer days.

So I have been learning to trade for nearly 3 years now and I have a strat that works well for me and has a relatively high win rate. It tends to follow the trend on higher time frames like the hourly and 4hr and I look for entries on the smaller time frames like 2min and 5min. I mainly use the volume profile to find imbalances in price where price reacted very aggressively to and travelled very quickly through. What I wanted to see was the aggressive reaction at the bottom LVN fade area and then to invalidate that previous low which is the green box and fail the retest of that low. Now price does this very well but one of the flaws of this strat is waiting for candle closures. So as you can see here it reacts aggressively to the LVN zone below and then the break and retest of the previously created low fails. But because I was waiting for a candle closure just past the green area I couldn't take the trade because it close way above it. For all the experienced traders out there, how could I look for entry confirmation that don't require candle closures. Would something like bookmap be beneficial for observing buying and selling pressure around this area to gauge absorption of sellers. Any tips would be really appreciated as this strat has taken some time to develop but I believe tuning the entry parameters could really stop me from missing good setups like this.

I had a trade go horribly wrong—*not* because of market volatility or poor risk management, but because of what looks like a platform malfunction. I was setting a **Buy Limit** on DOGEUSD at 0.20889. Instead, the platform executed a **Market Buy** at 0.22905 (about 10% higher) *without* any confirmation or manual input from me—and then auto-closed the trade *within one second*. Total loss: $20,160.

I had **no open or pending positions** at the time. I triple-checked before placing the order.

Their response? First they blamed spreads. Then they blamed me for using leverage. Then they said, essentially: “Well, it *looks* like you submitted a market order on our end,” and refused to request a full audit from TradeLocker (their platform provider) because *it wasn’t worth the time*. They also conveniently pointed out they “have zero control over the platform.”

So let me get this straight: they’re charging traders for access to an evaluation on a platform they don’t control, can’t audit, and won’t investigate when something goes wrong? That’s insane.

They eventually reset my account “as a favor” but refused to acknowledge anything was wrong.

Bottom line: If you value transparency, tech accountability, or even just basic professionalism—look elsewhere. This is a clown show wrapped in a funded account challenge.

Have since made and lost money on options but probably down 200-300K net at this point. Still have about 80K left, don't touch my 401K/Roth. Work in Tech so I can rebuild and understand I have a problem.

Current TC: 200K will try to allocate more aggressively to savings and upskilling my career while learning on the side.

  
Decided I should actually learn instead of what's essentially gambling with 0 DTE options / Long Dated Options.

  
My friends have suggested the following books and to begin with credit spreads:

  
\- Trading in the Zone: Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline and a Winning Attitude

\- Mastering the Trade, Third Edition: Proven Techniques for Profiting from Intraday and Swing Trading Setups

\- Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises

  
And YouTube: 

\- Tasty trade channel

  
I am setting this as a long term goal and expecting to rebuild slowly over the next 3-5 years and dip my toes into the market over time until I become more confident.

  
Open to all advice and help, thank you all. I had an unfortunate few years and healing from cPTSD and trying to take ownership and rebuild a new life by 40.

I’m being 100% real here—I have $10,000 saved and I’m trying to figure out the smartest way to grow it.

I’ve been learning about futures and have traded for the past few months. I have successfully made $50k in the past month using Prop Firms and Would like to use a portion of that profit to trade without any drawdown or buffer. I’m also not trying to blow my account because I understand the market is unpredictable, yes I’ve had my down days. The dream (yeah, it sounds crazy) is to one day turn this into $1 million and retire my family and make trading my job while supporting my family. I know it’s not overnight, but I’m serious about learning and putting in the work.

If you were starting today with $10K:

1.Would you go into futures?
2. If so, which broker would you recommend and why?
3. Or would you go another route (options, swing trading, copy trading, etc.)?

I’m looking for real advice, not hype. Appreciate anyone willing to share their experience or wisdom.

Thanks in advance.

If you ever see a live TikTok for RustyRod Trades, run and run fast.

The whole set up is a scam. They make it seem sweet trading as husband and wife, Rusty has heart problems and trading has made his life better for him and his family. He continuously gives out discount codes for Bulenox and Apex for 90% which seems insane, 50k account for like $13, you will obviously be tempted. He makes thousands each month from others using this codes. Have you seen how many times in a TikTok live he prompts the codes probably every 5 minutes. You can’t miss it.

I used those codes many times too.  He makes thousands per month from people buying accounts with his code. It only takes like 3-4 people to use the code once each to make around $100. Imagine how many people are using it, and not just for one account.

Anyway, I’ve been part of his paid discord for 6 months and not once does this guy show a single trade he makes, even when he’s asked by members. Not even past trades, he only shares charts he has made with key levels and pivot points but in a lot of cases they. There are so many people in his discord who share their screens and their trades they make, even their profits and loss, but not the actual host Rusty.

It seems when he gives a call out for a long, he will moments later give a call out for a short. His charts don’t always reflect his call outs either, I understand it can’t be perfectly accurate but to want people to pay to have access and to use these charts, you’d think they’d give more success over loss.

Here’s what grinds me the most, he offered a service where he would trade for members of the paid group. Obviously you had to send the money for the accounts, which he sets up and trades for you. Multiple people in the discord fell for this, it was called Hedge It Fund, he kept promising to send people the accounts/documents for them to see how it was going. But he was always too busy, with family, with trading with discord to truly give an evidence of what he was doing. Then out of nowhere this sub channel disappears, many of the members part of it disappear and it is like it never happened. As an idiot who fell for it, of course I messaged him to ask about it but no answer. He has answered other questions I ask but it seems he is avoiding that. But at least I have screenshots of this before he removed it. - the crazy part is, he was talking not long ago about doing it again. I assume since many of the originals left, he thinks nobody will see what is happening.

In theory, I don’t think his discord is for people to join and learn trading to be profitable. It’s just a scheme, with every live on TikTok, prompting his discount codes, charging $80 for a premium membership in his group, charging god knows how much for his charts, lessons etc. This guy is clearly making money, and not from trading, from idiots like me who want to learn more but need to filter through all this crap to find decent people/communities.

If you try to call him out in his discord or TikTok you get banned, so i thought id share my experience to Reddit, because if I can help others not fall for this scam its a win.

I’m sorry it’s a long post, but hopefully we can stop people like Rusty and others from scamming people.

If you have any bad experiences with a trading group, let others know. There should be a thread for groups people should avoid.

If I trade one of these instruments, it would be due to an economic event or a news and I would prefer to close the position (profit or loss) within the day, or next day at most.

Can't really decide whether or not I should stick to SPX/SPY options or ES/MES future.

What I like about the SPX or SPY options:  I know what my upfront maximum loss is even without a stop-loss  (the premium for long call/puts).   

What I do not like the SPX/SPY options:  less trading hours than ES/MES.    I have to make a decision on the Expiration date/Strike Price.

What I like about the ES/MES:  more trading hours, more simply as in I don't have to worry about Date/Price.

What I do not like about the ES/MES:   If i don't set a stop-loss,  the uncertainty of max loss.   My trading account would liquidate my position at 80% loss of my balance during my sleep for example.

What instrument do you think I should focus on for my trading needs?",My trading style I am not particularly good at technical analysis. If I trade one of these instruments it would be due to an economic event or a news and I would prefer to close the position profit or loss within the day or next day at most. Cant really decide whether or not I should stick to SPXSPY options or ESMES future. What I like about the SPX or SPY options I know what my upfront maximum loss is even without a stop-loss the premium for long callputs.

………..


So there I was — after a long night of gambling, drinking, some questionable decisions, and a sprinkle of Santa’s snow — and a wild thought hit me:

What if Satoshi isn’t gone? What if he’s just waiting?

Maybe he has an endgame we’ve never even considered. What if he’s still alive, sitting back and watching the chaos, while the world argues over whether Hal Finney was the real Satoshi? Or maybe it was Hal… or someone else who’s no longer with us, but who built a “sell when…” button for the moment the world finally tips.

Satoshi built Bitcoin as a trustless system. He didn’t trust banks, and he sure as hell didn’t build it to cozy up to governments. But here we are, more than a decade later — and now we’re talking about the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (still the dumbest name ever, by the way).

Yes — the United States, the same country that may have sparked the next global collapse after wrecking lives during the 2008 financial crisis, now wants to hold Bitcoin like it’s gold 2.0.

But what if this is all part of the plan?
What if Satoshi (or maybe his AI alter ego) is waiting for the U.S. to dive in — to officially become a HODLer — just so he can pull the trigger and crush the system that crushed so many?

Maybe Bitcoin wasn’t built to make us rich.
Maybe it was built for the biggest social experiment in modern history.

To expose greed.
To show how power always tries to creep in.
To prove that the early believers — the misfits, the rebels, the degens — were right all along.

At first, the elites laughed at Bitcoin.
Then they wanted a piece.
Now they want control.

But here’s the twist: Satoshi’s final move might be to sell it all. To trigger a meltdown just as the U.S. fully commits. A digital payback for all the lives wrecked in ’08.

Satoshi will rise.
And when he does, it won’t be for glory.
It’ll be for vengeance.

Alright… thanks for listening!

Reason for ETH instead of BTC, BTC is a market leader and the rest typically lags behind it, but much of the market is directly tied to the ETH chain and while most of the market does follow BTC, BTC generally out performs so IMO ETH makes the better bench mark for most pairs.

Short term 1-4h prediction is we see either sideways action or a slight bounce to the 2250-2300 range, if the daily bar breaks green or holds red hammer with small body long lower wick, we will likely see in the next 1 to 2 days a recovery and have ETH/EUR testing again the 2300-2350range, if it breaks out of that potential for a strong bull up to 24-2500

Invalidation and bear continuation if price breaks down below 2200 with high volume at any time today, in which case we will like see price testing support around the 2100€ range again.

I’ve probably spent the best part of the last 8 months researching and learning intensely, and I reached a point in April where I couldn’t look at the world the same any more.

I was already much more heavily allocated to bitcoin, I was buying daily, but I was still holding a lot of traditional assets, and I had this awful feeling every day. I could see all the problems, and the reality of the Ponzi scheme, as clear as anything, and still having part of me in that world was really weighing on me. So toward the start of last month, which is when the orange pill really got digested, I dumped everything, went full Bitcoin, and I can’t tell you how good it felt.

I’m at peace since doing it, couldn’t care if it dropped 80% tomorrow, I buy every day, fully automated deposits from my fiat bank, auto DCA, and auto withdrawal to cold storage. I no longer have a second job as a makeshift equity analyst, wasting hours each day keeping tabs on the market. I can now focus on my work, which I’m actually really good at and do genuinely enjoy, and on side projects that I’m truly passionate about.

I’m also a religious person, so breaking free from a system that is built on, and relies on usury for survival, made me feel a huge sense of relief.

If I had to point to the thing that was the final straw for me, it was realising the state of the bond markets / national debts, and the impending doom spiral that inevitably lies ahead. I don’t know how long it will take, but I’m certain everything I expect to come to pass, is going to.

I’m now on a mission to keep learning, and spread the word to every person I can. I have some cool ideas I’d like to work on within the Bitcoin ecosystem which I’m going to try and spend time on now.

I actually have a TikTok too, where I was previously me making videos about investing, but I’m now purely making videos about Bitcoin, Fiat systems and monetary truth. If anyone is interested I can share my username in the comments.

I use to think this topic was speculative, having read similar cases with RH and exchanges/banks over the past several years. Now it happened to me. Shocker.

However, FYSA my Robinhood account randomly has a restriction that forbids me to send crypto for no apparent reason. I chatted with RH Crypto agents, verified who I am, sent screenshots of the message issue, and answered their questions: (1. May we know what platform are you sending to?
2. Where were you sending the coins to?
3. Have you sent to that wallet before?
4. Are you sending to someone you know?)

In the end, the agent ends the chat with “investigating the issue”. No ticket number or even a follow up. Disappointing.

I did begin with the chat with “Are there any restrictions on my account?” I received an answer of “There are no restrictions on your account…” then proceeded with “Then why is there a restriction to send my crypto?” 
And so forth the verification and questions begin.

I’m just venting frustration and hopefully this will all get resolved in a timely manner.

I recently had two withdraws frozen for audit and one was kept in “audit” for over a month. When I reached out on telegram for their support I was blocked, same for twitter when I went to the website I seen all my withdraws that was in audit was now back in my account available. Unfortunately I had already been banned from my own account.

after doing more digging, I realized I’m not alone. Here’s what you need to know:

🔹 Shady Withdrawals – Funds go in easy, but good luck getting them out. I had delays, constant excuses, and eventually no response at all.
🔹 Zero Transparency – There’s no real team presence, no audits, and very little verifiable info about who’s behind it.
🔹 Fake Hype & Bots – The activity on social media and the platform itself seems heavily manipulated. Lots of fake engagement to create an illusion of popularity.
🔹If you’re already in, get your funds out if you still can. If you’re thinking about using it, don’t.

There are legit platforms out there. This one isn’t it.
Stay safe, do your own research, and don’t let your guard down in this space.

I started live trading in February. My system involves selling credit spreads of 5 points with a premium of $1-1.50, exiting at $0.30-$0.50.

Entry rules:
- VWAP breakout/reversal/crossovers with MACD, RSI, OBV, and MA cross confirmation.
- Enter after 10 AM, latest by 12 PM.
- Always trade with the trend, not against it.

Exit rules:
- If price re-enters VWAP (if breakout has occurred) or if the trade reverses.
- Exit latest 1 hour to 30 minutes before close.

During Powell's speech, I wait for him to start speaking before entering a trade, looking for direction.

I’ve traded SPX every single trading day since I started paper trading, and I continued this after going live while also experimenting with different entries. Totaling about 180 trades (120 paper & 60 live) During those trades, I had a 100% win rate—none of my positions were assigned at close, and I was always able to exit.

If I hadn’t made any mistakes, I would have netted $20,000 over the past 3 months.

To explain what happened: I trade with my brother, who introduced me to options. I mainly do overnight and swing trades. He inputs the orders, and I spot the entries.

First incident: On March 17, my brother accidentally placed a paper trade as a live trade with an oversized position (50 lots). Then, the market crashed due to bessant comments. We panicked, rolled down half the position, and rolled over the other half to another day. When it rallied, we forgot about the rollover and sold it at a green P&L on ToS, only to find out we lost $10,000.
After that, we put the paper trade on another device.

Second incident: On April 30, my brother traded a sell call vertical spread, then fell asleep. I forgot to close it too, and last-minute earnings calls leaks put us in the money, resulting in a $2,500 loss. Since then, we set up an auto-close order 30 minutes before the market closes.

Third incident: On May 7, a fat-finger incident increased our position from 2 to 100 lots. After the last incident, we decided to close it immediately, which cost us $2,000. If we had held, we might have profited, but considering the other side of the trade, we preferred to close it. We decided to limit the order size to 5 in the system.

Finally, on May 21, my win streak was broken, and I lost $1,000 (my trading system's maximum loss).

So during my 6 months of paper trading and 3 months of live trading, I had a 99% win rate, but that doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing.

Technically, I am still up $4,500 this year, but with my win streak broken, I'm uncertain if my risk-reward ratio is correct since I’m just 4 losing days away from being in the red. Therefore, I’ve decided to walk away from 0DTE SPX for now until I regain more buffer from my commodities ETF wheeling.

(If you saw my previous post about losing $10,000 on a revenge trade, I didn’t include that since I made it back already with SPX buy options—thanks to Trump’s trade deals with Britain.)

My advice:
- Don’t trust paper trading; it always looks greener (I am literally up $50,000 on my paper trades). It has deceptive fill rates.

- Don’t underestimate fat-finger incidents; lock your size limit before it’s too late.

- Quitting losing trades and taking profits early is totally fine compared to facing a maximum loss (stick to your risk-reward ratio).

- Watch your mental capital and fatigue; it can drain much more quickly than you think.",Not looking for a sob story just want to share my 3-month live trading and 6-month paper trading journey on 0DTE SPX trades highlighting how fatigue can impact you even if your system has a 99% win rate.

Advice Request","Hi All,

I'm evaluating my strategy of selling **1-2 week covered calls** on **Google (GOOG)** and **Robinhood (HOOD)**, with the plan to buy them back after a week to capture most of the premium.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you have any better strategies for generating income with covered calls on these stocks?

Specifically, I'm looking for recommendations on:

* **Optimal expiration periods**
* **Strike price selection**
* **Managing assignments**
* Any **specific experiences with GOOG or HOOD**

When you get a mortgage, the bank doesn’t lend you money it already has. It just creates it. Literally types it into existence. It’s new money that didn’t exist until you took out the loan.

Then you spend 25–30 years repaying it with interest often tens or hundreds of thousands extra, all for money the bank didn’t even have before.

That interest is their profit.
They created the money.
You repay it in full.
With interest.
And if you can’t pay? They take your house.

It feels insane that this is how the system actually works and it’s just accepted as normal.

Bitcoin is the exact opposite:
	•	No one can just create it at will
	•	It has a hard cap (21 million)
	•	You actually own it
	•	It runs on rules, not privilege

There’s no central institution that gets to “print” Bitcoin and collect interest on it for decades. And no one can inflate it to bail themselves out.

I see it as the only way out of a debt-based system that feels incredibly rigged.

I’m still learning. Just wild to realise how deep the rabbit hole goes when you actually start asking where money comes from.

Even though RANDAO seeds are known in advance, sudden changes in validator balances can shift who becomes proposer, even at the last second.  
  
That unpredictability causes problems.



  
  
3/6 **EIP-7917 fixes it. How does it work?**  
  
At the start of each epoch, Ethereum creates a list called proposer\_lookahead showing which validators will propose blocks for the current and upcoming epochs.  
  
When a new epoch starts, the list updates by removing old proposers and adding new ones.  
  
This list is stored on-chain, so smart contracts can easily see who proposes next, making confirmations faster and more reliable. Simple, yet brilliant!



  
4/6 **Why it matters?**  
  
• It boosts Layer 2 solutions by making preconfirmation protocols simpler and more reliable, which supercharges based rollups.  
  
• Predictable proposer schedule.  
  
• Cleaner design: Resolves a long-standing beacon chain inconsistency.





5/6 **Connection with other EIPs.**  
  
**EIP-7917** is joining seven other EIPs in the lineup. It’ll debut in the fusaka-devnet-1 release, set to launch June 9.   
  
Devs call it a “minimal lift” with outsized impact, just 22 lines of spec code to unlock all these goodies.



  
6/6 **Ethereum is evolving fast. Fusaka is just one more step.**  
  
Ethereum just keeps getting better. EIP-7917 is the kind of upgrade that makes Ethereum feel more complete.  
  
What do you want to see fixed or improved next?  
  
Drop your thoughts in the comments.",16 What is EIP-7917 Its an Ethereum proposal that makes the block proposer schedule fully deterministic meaning well know ahead of time exactly who is proposing each block. 26 Right now proposer schedules are partly unpredictable.
